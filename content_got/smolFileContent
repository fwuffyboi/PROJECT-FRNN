I am working on a new passion project, a VR/Vtuber YouTube Channel. I want to explore a new side of furry content that isn't all fursuits. I'll be posting every Monday & Friday, so check it out if you want! :3

update:

I now have too many tweets in my database. With 53 million tweets, it's slower to access a tweet inside the sqlite database than it is in the Twitter API

(I should probably work on optimizing it now)

trend
I wanna try something:

What's one metric or stat you've always wanted to know about furries?

Reply or quote rt this post with your question... If I can, I will try to answer it using the data I've collected on Twitter!
it's really fascinating to see my twitter data collection algorithm get faster and faster as more users are cached into my database.
Anyways, there's a random thread of what I've been thinking about over the past 15 minutes.

Will I implement it anytime soon? Probably not. But I think it would make a great V2 for the furry detector, as long as I can figure out how to make it fast enough to be worthwhile to use
Another problem I see is that I don't really evaluate the user themselves, only their friends. It is definitely possible that I trigger false positives, especially with those who are furry adjacent (such as artists, programmers, etc.)
One of the biggest problems is that this method would be n-times slower (n being the sample size), than just using the furry detector on that person in the first place. I would sacrifice speed for accuracy.

(And I also have no idea how accurate this method is)
With only a sample size of 10, the probability of all of them being wrong is already a 9.76E-12% chance.

The false positives and negatives that my furry detector gives becomes a non issue at large sample sizes.

A short  on my relationship with my boo:

It might just look like we’re the perfect couple and everything is roses and peachy all day.

On social media we often only portray the good and cute side, in reality our relationship is like anyone else’s.
I want to wear some with Fluke. I think that would be so sexy

Watching The Polar Express.
Gosh that kid on the train is so annoying
Just had a fruit drop.
The movie came out in 1988 and they  still make the collector tin.
Roger Ebert the film critic said it belongs on anyone’s list of great war films.
I must say I agree with him.
I’m two hours south of Chicago.
My package  went from Chicago Ridge to Maine then to Massachusetts, like ???

People say Twitter is a depressing hellscape. Why? It's yours to make your own - use the block, follow, unfollow and mute options freely and strategically.

My twitter is full of you lovely, inspiring mutuals who make my day better, so it's an uplifting place.
god damn I forgot how fast phones can be when they're not 3 years old

I really wish more folks would understand this especially on Telegram. I’m really busy a lot and enjoy talking to my friends but I can’t do it all the time. I still want to scroll social media and lurk in group chats though but it’s nothing malicious against a single person
