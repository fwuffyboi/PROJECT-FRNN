 If the Supreme Court over turns Roe v. Wade all I can picture is this country's motto will no longer be "Life. liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
Why? Because you will have to live your life a someone else sees fit.

The pursuit of profit? -- really? -- you do know what country this is right?  This nation was founded on the belief that white men are the superior race, women and minorities are totally inferior, and MONEY & POWER are the sole reasons for existence. Capitalism run amok.
We're excited to announce our 30-member Racial Equity in Guided Pathways Commission. They will radically reimagine how to meet the specific needs of #communitycollege #students of color in #California. This race-centric model will accelerate our pursuit of #racialequity.

The way this conversation has gone so far is that you said people should have unobstructed access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I said poor kids don't get this because of, among other things, lack of safe housing.
When the words promising us Life Liberty and the pursuit of happiness were written, they were not written only for those who were alive in that day, but they were written for future generations, all of whom were unborn.
The Constitution does not give the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to a fetus but it does to living human beings outside the womb.  Guns kill people including children.  Four lives were just lost and yet you haven't said squat.
Maybe it's an intellectual pursuit and she's a fan of the mathematics of cryptography

-Viktor, Arcane
the story unfolds into one of the most poignant, original epics capturing how it feels for  a cusp millennial-zoomer to be alive as the sun sets on an empire, atomized and pursuit of a coherent digital selfhood, too zoomer for the millennials, and too millennial for the zoomers.
Abortion isn't that black and white. The issue really is how much should society infringe a woman's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to protect those rights of the unborn child.
Another great selection of FREE games. Once again if anyone has any spare keys they don't need let me know. I am on the lookout for NFS Hot Pursuit, Frostpunk & Journey to the Savage Planet.
What does making the world a better place mean? Objective search for the truth is the only principled pursuit of learning
You mean like God does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked but he unconditionally elects them to eternal damnation based on nothing good or bad they did for His pleasure?

Nanotech was not a word, or a brand, or a startup incubator. It was an acronym that brought together the passions of a marketing genius and a physicist.
For Nanotechnology, discovery was not just an intellectual pursuit; it was an art.
I understand. But honestly all politics are local right?  We need grass root efforts to promote our right to life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are not secondary to the right to own a gun. Currently, they are.
When does the endowment of our creator to LIFE, liberty and the pursuit of happiness end, and the 2nd amendment begin? Asking for some kids in Michigan. Oh and New Jersey. Oh and Colorado. Oh and fill in the blank.
Never NEVER call your fursuit a mascot costume when dealing with customs.
"Mascot" implies you intend to do promotional work. You will likely get pulled aside and screened under suspicion of intending to work without a visa.

Now I know what to say after my roommate at a convention decides to fursuit for an entire day in Japanese
He gets it. He really gets it. Telling other people how to live their lives with no perspective or understanding is the most American thing there is
The only thing I'm better at than subjecting people to my unsolicited opinions is trivial pursuit

To Democrats it means kids grow up with the chance to have a life and the liberty to pursue happiness.

I mean the R of 9 was without mitigation no? I'm just trying to say it's not doom and gloom, i feel like your post was needlessly doom. If you want better science ask the furry scientist who's actually qualified to speak on this

You need to shame him for being a furry. Early and often, maybe you can save him from a horrible fate.
So pure I love it

To win or lose, succeed or fail, is sometimes not as important as trying and giving our best despite all the challenges that befall us. Life does not allow us to consistently control outcomes but we can control our efforts. That means something.

Growth comes in many forms. Some may need to retract. Some may need more support or more space. Regardless of what this year has been for you, find the strength to move forward. Grow. Be that better person you idolize and wanna be.

Somewhere in the distance
There's a voice that calls

To be free once more

Wanna know why you should appreciate nice and good people. Because it takes far more effort to be nice than nasty. So when someone is being nice to you, just remember they are making an effort to be nice to you. Nasty toxic people don't make an effort.
If you put your mind  to it, you can accomplish anything !
In this hard times optimist and empathy  gonna lead us to a better tomorrow!

True love means that despite no matter how hard things get, no matter how much you fight, no matter how many problems you have, you work through it at and at the end of the day you still love your partner the same

Throughout all of this, one thing shined through any of the roughest times, and that would without a doubt, be my friends. I owe so much to them, and I'm absolutely surrounded by some of the most amazing people I've ever met.
Thank you.
Heading onward to new horizons.
So, it's the new year. 2019 was really interesting, to say the least. some of the highest highs I've ever had, and my lowest lows. It was one hell of a roller coaster for me, but ultimately it led to me bettering myself and learning how to cope with certain things, y'know?
>
why has nobody made a VR game where you dual with lightsabers. that would be so cool.
I WOULD BUY THAT.
Fiiiiinally back home after a really fun weekend in the city!
It's a new year!!!
I have a lot of plans, aspirations and things I want to do this year, and i'm excited to get to actually doing them! Buuuuut i'm super tired so i'm going to have some TEA FIRST then sleep!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

Good news! My mother is no long showing any more symptoms. We have a specialist  going with us step by step on what to do. My mother no longer in quarantine & feeling back to normal as so as my other parts of the family as well recovered. I am so relieved & not stressing any more
Another confirm case  but this time from my mother who I live with. We are taking precaution and keeping distance. I'm going out getting tested to be safe by next week when they open for the drive-thru test. This is really stressing me out. Please stay safe out there.

Sadly to say that I am canceling FE2020 and donating my reg.  I was looking forward to this con and been trying to go for many years. Lot of friends and family are worried for my heath and recommend me to stay. I can always try for next years.
Unsure to attend FE and donate my registration and go next year's. I'm keeping an eye out if things get worse. I'll decide on Sunday or Monday if I'm going or not.
Reminder, we are still taking applications for the fursuot charity dance auction.
Slots this year are limited and we are closing submissions on April 20th.
To those who have already replied, you may expect an answer soon.
I'm thinking I'm getting more sick. Taking medication and vitamins to feel better before it gets worse. It's slowly creeping on me. I don't want con crud again Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I want to make awesome paws.

This con hahaha...legit! ANW is good ish XD
From the call today and the damage is not fixable it seems. I had that Pathfinder for a good 7 years and also just payed it off a few months back with new tires, brakes and rotor, battery, oil change, renew license plates, new timing center. Feels all that went to waste
Welp my car is a totaled loss. Got the call from the car repaired, Rip.  Now got to wait for updates later from the insurance.
Good bye #ANW2019 It's been so fun! Hope to be there next year!

I love how every time I look at twitter I am reminded of why I try not to look at twitter.
I've been adding so much more details to Izzy's mane compared to when I drew her for the very first time!
Also my facial expressions have gotten better! o3o
WHY?!
We may or may not be at mff this year do to some other obligations that just came up. I will keep everyone posted but I do still want to get moving on this project
I am thinking about trying to film season 2 of the fandom at some point in this coming year. Would anyone be interested in chatting at MFF or TFF this year?
I just  want you all to know that I am finding my way again, that I am sorry its taken so long and that I love you all so much. Thank YOU for making this journey a magical one.
Since releasing it I fell into a depression. One that I have only been able to peak out of a few times since. The more visible I got the harder it was for me to be me. In so many ways I have just withdrawn from everything.
Hey so I just wanted to say something because I feel like it needs to be said. When we released the fandom it was a project that was a labor of love for our small team. Going through that experience took an incredible toll on myself in almost every facet of my life.
Heyo just a reminder to everyone I am still taking a break from social media and really only check this account in the morning. I just dont have the energy to deal with stuff these days

#mlp #mlpg5 #MyLittlePonyANewGeneration #fanart
So I will be attending MFF assuming work doesn't eat up all my free time but it will probably be a pretty low key con for me because I haven't had a relax con since like a year before the pandemic.
I wish we could attend BLFC but life is too busy atm. Looking forward to seeing all you amazing folks soon.

It is important for me to mention that messages, comments etc- will be shared with Ash through myself. It is my job help Ash manage this account because as we all know, running a Twitter account is a lot of work! Thank you all for the support as we make this transition
Hello all! Ash's Social Media Manager here! I thought I'd share some fun facts about me to help introduce myself
- I've been in the furry fandom for over 10 years!
- My favourite animals are African Wild Dogs
Starting now my account is being handled by my social media manager. Lots of love everyone! See you on youtube ^_^
I might be trans.
I have received a few messages about unfollowing folks accounts, this is apart of preparing this account for business and handing it off to my social media manager.

Thank you
@/AshCoyote
 for putting together this amazing documentary, I was emotional during the whole thing. I remember joining the fandom and not knowing anything about myself and now after being here, discovering myself and meeting so many awesome people. This fandom is my home.
I joined the furry fandom at 29.
Does that make me an undead furry?
I just donated to The Homeless Black Trans women fund. You should too!

This is where unlimited corporate money in politics has gotten us. Politicians claiming that people ought to sacrifice their lives on the altar of "the economy".
Getting money out of politics isn't some abstract issue, it is life and death.
Soooo, Trump says that the coronavirus pandemic could until July or August...... or longer. I think we can consider 2020 officially canceled
There are two types of dogs...
please consider this persuasion for little tail sleeves from an ergonomic and ass-concerned standpoint
It's amazing on how much the furry fandom is grown a lot over the years. But it's incredible to see how supportive this community really is too.

When you draw the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group, you may want to re-think things...
Has anyone ever offered you sexual favors in exchange for transport or room fees at a convention?
Have you ever skipped paying rent or bills to go to a convention?
We do have a fair percentage that are younger than 18...
Should Furries use sites like GoFundMe to crowd-fund fursuit purchases?
We welcome so many new furries.  It's okay...he can "come out of the woods" as soon as he feels comfortable!
Not having a suit doesn't make you any less of a furry. It also shouldn't make you less-respectable in the fandom.
We are sad to confirm the loss of a congoer last night; authorities indicate natural causes. An earlier alcohol based incident was unrelated

Thank you so much dude for bringing him to life!! <3 <3 <3
Just a note that I have to make for everyone that commissioned a furry machine fursuit so far...
You guys are awesome, thanks for making my work with fursuits possible, thanks for allowing me to have this job, I'm glad and lucky to meet such nice and great people!
It's getting hard and expensive to get Fur due to shipping costs +  brazilian import taxes that are 60%  of the total amount for federal taxes + 25% for state taxes and they want to raise the taxes further!
I got my BEANS from

I'm giving everything that I have right now to make the best I can including improving some little quirks on my fursuit head shapes, making a much better lining inside the head, improving ventilation, weight, ease to wear, to clean and overall durability.
Sometimes if feels like punching water and not getting anywhere, but today I'm super happy with the results and I'm much more confident to move forward with the next commissions.
Also thanks a lot for the patience of those that are still waiting on their suits from me.
The work time and patience invested to fix some little bugs on my moving jaws is finally paying off getting some nice results. It has been a challenge to make a mechanism that doesn't require screws, elastic or springs, it has been over 2 years since I draw the first ideas.

We are  going to hold on this cat for while, we are working a deal with the current fursuit commission owner, so we believe he can afford the last payent by August 23th.

I think we finally covered and organized the house and workshop enough to be able to go back on building suits again.
So, I've decided that before I put this fursuit for auction I want to give a chance for people to get it for a solid price of $ 3000 USD + Shipping.
We may put this kitty for auction later.
It's a full suit that I've done for a client here in Brazil as a commission but he couldn't afford to finish paying.
We made a deal that we can sell the suit with full rights for the fursona as well.
Just now I found out that I took this pics on the same position in two different situations with two different hobbies. Lol
So, I will enjoy it to do an fursuit vs fursuiter
#fursuit #fursuiter
Time to Sorocaba install some shelves.
It's been a while since the last time I ride a bus.
@/The_Peppercat
  made the fur and shelves layout.
It's still a work in progress, will look much better and organized after we get everything placed.
Since we got a lot of stuff done today we could update a bit more the workshop.
Little by little we are getting all the things placed and working, we are almost done with everything.
Today I went out with my mother in law to help her to get stuff done and tomorrow I need update the bills on my name this on the new house.
Assembling new workshop at the new house.
The cats accepted the new house very well, and we finally brought all of our stuff, time to unpack everything and put some appliances working.
Bringing the left over stuff to the new house, two more trips to go yet.
Thanks everyone for the 7K followers.
Now let's look for the 8k, 9k and 10k.
Lots of traffic today.
We still have stuff left behind to bring to the new house.
Very soon we will be living and working over here.

Truck drivers got what they were asking and they are going back to work little by little.
Things are slowly settleling down in Brazil.
The situation in Brazil right now is so Rough, that we can not even send people to hell because there is no gasoline to get over there.
We're currently facing a terrible crisis here in Brazil. I hope they come to an agreement fast, since many people have been and are being affected. As for myself, biggest concern is not having fuel, even if I... try to go somewhere else. Geez.
yeah... they still didin't solve the issue yet, there are a lot of truck drivers that are still on strike.  I comemorated too early. ^^'''
Good news. after 4 days of Stryke, the goverment offered one deal in exchange of 15 days of truce.
I already got my tank full to the top in case I need.
All truck drivers in Brazil are on strike since this last monday, gas stations are running out of fuel, food stocks are low, supermarkets are running out of products, there is 40% less bus on the streets even some airports are without fuel.
I am not worthy...
Page 11 of these!
I spent a couple hours today checking my emails and facebook messages and duuuude, I keep finding so cool characters, hard to choose one favorite.
I appreciate all the attention that everyone is giving to Furry Machine lately, and I also have to say I have gotten great people on my commission list last year, I want to talk and answer everybody, but the demand has increased much more than I can manage at the moment.

We can't let things get worse! Do what you can to stop the worst from happening!
Yes, this is incredibly disappointing news, but yelling on Twitter in English isn't really going to do much to make our voices heard to the Japanese branch of the company.

Grown adults grooming minors is NOT okay. Pedophiles are terrible people.
Minors in this community, please remember it's not normal for grown adults to be attracted to you. They might sweet talk you and make you believe it's OK, that you're the one exception, mature for your age etc.
These are grooming techniques. They know what they're doing.

The Police are pigs and the only good police officers are the ones that quit or get fired because they are good.
No no no. Media please don't do this.
*Police* killed 8-year-old Fanta Bility.
*Police* say teenagers were involved in a separate conflict blocks away and claim that's why they fired their guns.
The teenagers had no role in her death.
For once, don't buy the police narrative.

june 2020 vs now
Just under a month ago women were manhandled & arrested by Met police in Clapham Common for holding a peaceful vigil in honour of Sarah Everard. Laws are not enforced consistently, they are selectively enforced in the interest of an increasingly corrupt state apparatus.
So the police won't use brute force to disperse a crown outside of a soccer stadium, but they will on a cancelled vigil that happens a week later in the same sovereign country?

If you made a video with my music and recently received a claim by Frederator - that is my MCN searching out for my content and claiming it like our music usage rules state! Not a false claim!
Why even bother signing up for these notifications??? Even 100K tier creator events are full by the time notifications are sent! I clicked it up immediately!

The Animals Who Read welcome all who enjoy reading about conservation, endangered species, and preserving our planet.
Let's learn about the amazing career of ZOOKEEPING!
#DYK Flamingos have more in common with whales than other birds when it comes to feeding. That's because flamingos are filter-feeders! Complex rows of horny plates line their beaks which are used to strain food items, like crustaceans, from the water, much like baleen whales do.
Interested in a career working with animals? Join me this afternoon for a detailed discussion on the choices you can make to start pursuing the career of your dreams
Tune in at 4PM EST on Twitch or Zoolife
Chromatophores are some of the most interesting cells I EVER learned about in my academic career. Seeing cephalopods change not only colour but also texture will never stop blowing my mind

You never know what you're going to catch on Zoolife...
Come vibe with me while I work on my newsletter and other nerdy science communication things!
Our team recently pulled out the cleaning equipment again and set to work beautifying display specimens throughout the galleries. If you could get up close to any fossil, which one would you choose?
It's SO hard to believe MFF is RIGHT around the corner!
Who are we going to see there?
What do moray eels and Alien have in common?  Terrifying inner jaws! Yes, seriously! Sitting beside this eel skull is the pharyngeal jaw which is normally located in their throat. They extend it out when they're feeding for a better grip on their prey!
#DYK The scientist who first described the Pampas cat in literature used the scientific name of colocolo in honour of a Mapuche leader of Chile.
Feedback Needed!
I won't have a booth at MFF but, I am considering doing at-con merch pickups if there is enough interested.
If I were to open a form for print and sticker orders, who would be interested?

It may seem unexpected to hear this but, hyenas DO have winter coats!  The range of hyenas once extended far across Eurasia during the Ice Age. In fact, they were the dominant predator of that time and area - even out competing cave lions, wolves, and early humans!
 Why are snakes important?
 As predators and prey, snakes keep ecosystems in balance.
 Snakes help humans as a natural form of pest control.
  Snakes are fascinating animals!
 What else? What is your #1 reason why snakes are important?

There was a lot of moments that led Tippi in this direction but, none more influential than the bloody disaster that was the filming of the 1981 film "Roar".
Of the 140 person crew, more than half of them suffered injuries from the big cats.
Fun Fact. This is Tippi Hedren.
Yes, from "The Birds".
Before the Tiger King, she was the Tiger Queen. After growing up in the world of exotic ownership, she founded the Shambala Preserve in 1983 which is now dedicated to educating others about the dangers of big cats as pets.

Glass frogs - a frog so transparent you don't even need an x-ray or MRI to see inside of them!
Tasmanian devils don't just exist in Looney Toons! The name for this little mammal originates from the first European settlers on the island state of Tasmania who heard mysterious growls and screams in the night.  This later encouraged the inclusion of "devil" in its.
The nearly five-inch-long tongue of a kinkajou allows them to expertly reach inside flowers or beehives for tasty honey or nectar

This notoriously shy shark has a powerful secret tool - its tail. The thresher shark's tail makes up half of its body length and is used to stun its prey. By swiping their tail in a trebuchet-like motion, thresher's are able to hit fast enough to create a stunning shockwave

This smooth-fronted caiman, native to both the Amazon and Orinoco river basins, lays its eggs at the end of the dry season. To maintain an elevated incubation temperature, these crocodilians sometimes build nests near or on top of active termite mounds.
Some see Toughie as just one frog of one species. But, he's representative of a widespread issue not only impacting the amphibians of our planet but all aspects of biodiversity. Too often we start to care about these animals when it is already too late. We should care now.

Monkey Tailed Skink climbing over to say hello!  This species gets its name from its prehensile tail which they use to climb through the trees!
Hoatzins apparently never got the message that they aren't dinosaurs anymore as the chicks grow claws on their forelimbs. It's more than just an interesting look, however. These claws allow them to climb back up to their nests should they need to leave it to escape predators.

Just taught the first class for my Zoology semester class on Outschool and, gosh, my students are so great! Moments like tonight remind me why I love what I do so much. Seeing how excited people get to learn new things about animals makes me
Furry Migration is almost HERE! Just three more days until I go! Hard to believe I will be going back to the states finally after a whole year away. I cannot wait to see my friends, make new ones, and see all of you at the con!

I will literally CRY tears of happiness when I see this suit in person.
Another amazing species succumbing the affects of human caused change. I fear for the future should we not act to save our planet and reverse the trend.
The Furry Migration Schedule is OUT and along with it all of the times for my panels! Check them out in SciFurs thread here or through FM's website directly
Tank is trying his best, okay?
Enrichment doesn't always have to be easy for the animal. Changing things up and allowing them a chance for some problem solving makes those little tortoise brains go!

Crocodiles Of The World
Threatening the facility this happened at, harassing their staff, and general negativity does NOTHING to help this situation. What happened, happened. What is important is that the zoo and staff improve going forward.
It is clear the keeper messed up. It is clear safety protocols need to be reevaluated including having backup keepers on stand by so guests do not have to be involved. But, we should ABSOLUTELY recognize how this keeper was able to get herself out of this situation so easily.
That. Is. AMAZING.
The wooden poles are used to guide the animal through gentle pressure on the tip of their snouts or on other areas. Target sticks serve as a visual cue to tell the animal where you want them to go. You can also teach alligators to station, come, and more through verbal commands.
Typically, when working with large crocodilians, multiple tools are utilized to ensure the safety of the zookeeper as well as to communicate effectively with the animal. This usually involves wooden poles, target sticks, and related devices.
Gators are capable of being trained to respond to verbal & visual cues. This form of training, often referred to as husbandry training, enables keepers to work safely with dangerous animals while minimizing the stress an animal may have during routines such as veterinary exams.
There are currently 201 known adult kakapos left in the world - each with their own name. All of them have been named by the Kakapo Recovery Program which extensively monitors the critically endangered birds. That's a BIG increase from 1995 when there were only 51 birds left.

Happy to say that as of this morning I have started my Canadian permanent residency journey! Signed the paperwork with my immigration lawyer to start the process, now to fill out mountains and mountains of paperwork!
The Red-Capped Manakin might be one of the best dancers in the animal kingdom. In fact, there are over FIFTY species of manakins and they ALL perform elaborate courtship displays to impress the ladies - including Michael Jackson's famous moonwalk.

Mmmm... tasty slug snack.
NOT REALLY THOUGH!
Banana slugs defend themselves by producing A LOT of mucus, causing their predators' mouths to be filled with GOOP. The goop is also an anesthetic, meaning it will make a predator's tongue and throat go numb

The snakes are coming, the snakes are coming! As oceans are warmed by climate change, yellow-bellied sea snakes are becoming increasingly comfortable in New Zealand waters.

The Cuban crocodile is the most terrestrial of extant crocodiles, capable reaching speeds of up to 11 mph. It is also one of the most critically endangered with its range reduced to only two areas -  the Zapata Swamp and Isla de la Juventud.
Velvet Ants, known as "Cow Killers", are actually parasitoid wasps. They get their name from the urban legend that their string is so painful it is able to kill a cow.
Known as the King of the cattail, male red-winged blackbirds will not hesitate to divebomb larger predators or even other birds. More than a quarter of each day is spent chasing off or at least pestering perceived threats.

Meet the polka-dot tree frog. Secretions along the frog's skin cause it to emit a greenish blue fluorescent glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. Because it is linked to secretions from glands in the skin, they can also leave fluorescent markings as they move
Although most people believe black mambas get their name from the color of their bodies, the name is actually because of the inside of their mouths. When threatened, the snake is quick to draw back into a striking position, and open the mouth to expose the black interior.
Ever seen a cat that has a permanent  face? Well, meet the Rusty-Spotted Cat! Or... should I say... the kitten of one! Measuring at 14-19 inches in body length as an adult, this adorable wild cat can easily fit into the palms of your hands

#DYK There are FRESHWATER dolphins? Amazon river dolphins are among the largest freshwater dolphins in the world and are found in...well.. the Amazon! The species is vulnerable in certain areas due to dams that fragment and threaten certain populations, and water contamination.

Diamondback terrapins are believed to be the only turtle in the world that lives exclusively in brackish water. Brackish water is essentially a type of water that is not quite fresh... but not quite salt. The exact amount of salinity can vary wildly!

SEA SQUIRREL! But, make it... worm.
Sand cats are NOT hydro homies  Or... maybe they are? Like many desert-dwelling species, sand cats can survive without drinking water for WEEKS! Most, if not all, of the moisture they need is absorbed from their prey.
 Clyde Nishimura, Smithsonian's National Zoo
It's #WorldLizardDay!  Let's talk about the adorable armadillo girdled lizard. If it senses danger, it puts its tail in the mouth to form a spherical shape that enables it to roll - just like its namesake. They are found along the western coast of South Africa
Little baby gecko feet
Sometimes it is the little moments that make all those long days worth it. A guest came in with their little boy who was very excited to give us a drawing they did of one of our crocodiles. Before we placed it in our break room, we asked for his autograph

This is so awesome! If your company, university, or any organization uses Zoom, ask them to enable this feature
Pregnant Snake!  Well, sort of? This Eyelash viper is getting ready to "pop" as she is currently full of babies. This species is ovoviviparous meaning the eggs form inside and hatch internally before giving live birth.

Mia, the Hog Island Boa, says hello!
I am just thankful she had a few good months with us - full of sunshine, yummy food, and lots of love.
It seems almost poetic that she crossed over last night... as today we had already made the difficult decision to euthanize her. Star's improvement had stalled over the past few weeks and we believe kidney failure had set in.
Heartbroken. This little beardie, affectionately named Star, crossed over the rainbow bridge sometime last night. She had improved so much over the past few months but it was not enough. I just wish we were here with her when she crossed
Psst. His name is Friday
You have been blessed with the Friday snout of good luck. Pass it around.
This frog isn't actually grumpy - that's just how the Black Rain Frog looks! Native to the southern coast of Africa, this species is known for its impressive burrowing skills and their defensive mechanisms. When attacked, they PUFF UP big and round
Amazing people doing some amazing work for tigers!

Beautiful red-eyed tree frog  Despite their bright coloring, this species is actually not poisonous, instead relying on camouflage to protect themselves.

Hi. Self-respecting Herper here.
This beautiful snek right here is Rocky the Burmese Python. Snek. I said it.
Just because you're from a small town, doesn't mean you can't grow up to do great things and create change in the world

Snack Time for Tequila!  Tequila is a venomous species of lizard known as a Gila monster. Gila monsters will often eat up to ONE-THIRD of their body weight in one meal! Their diet includes a variety of critters such as small mammals, eggs, frogs, and even... other LIZARDS
It's not just Thailand going through this. The zoological based tourism industry around the world is suffering more than you may think. Accredited zoos, historic aquariums, privately owned ventures... We risk losing them more and more without increased financial support
I have said this so many times but I'm saying it again - I work with some of the most amazing people I have ever met. From the zookeepers to the front end retail to the volunteers and everyone inbetween, they all make me feel so lucky to be where I am  Life is great!
My heart is so full!  My staff surprised me today with an incredibly sweet card and a GATOR themed french press   Despite being an avid coffee drinker, this is actually the FIRST french press I have ever owned. I'm so thrilled to use it!

#HappyPride
I JUST TAUGHT MY FIRST OUTSCHOOL CLASS!  And, my students were absolutely WONDERFUL! I was worried teaching through VR would come off strange but I honestly think it made even more engaging for everyone! Can't wait to teach more!
P.S. Don't think that we don't notice those of you that are now tweeting "Happy Pride" as if a few weeks ago you weren't talking about how it was cringe  Funny how some of you start singing a different tune when it is now advantageous to you, huh?
As someone who grew up in a very close-minded and homophobic town, pride is a very much needed celebration. This is the one time of year a lot of us finally feel comfortable to be ourselves.
It is not cringe.
It is not stupid.
Let us have our moment
Bath time for a uromastyx  Regular baths help keep reptiles nice and hydrated!

Anyone have any Twitch team recommendations? I have been working on being a part of Wild Abandon but was not able to get an application in quick enough for either of their openings. Feeling really discouraged and hope there may be some alternatives out there to help me grow.
Although this particular sign is not government issued nor official, the text in the bill is still just as bad. This is one of the most absurd things I have ever heard of or seen. Pictured here is what the "official" signage is most likely to look like.
Tennessee businesses who allow patrons to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity are now being forced to display discriminatory signs to "warn" others they may see trans people inside. All in thanks to HB 1182. This is disgusting.

I know I have angered people in the past about this. I have been called a fun ruiner or been told "you must be fun at parties".
I don't care what you think of me.
I will call out abuse as I see it.
Please stop reposting content from terrible, abusive facilities.
Anytime you repost, like, share, or interact in anyway with the content created by these Tiger King stars you are supporting this abuse.
STOP giving them the attention and support.
STOP perpetuating this suffering.
Since September 2020, the Department of Justice reports AT LEAST three big cat cubs died of malnutrition and two others died under "suspcious circumstances". The remainder are said to have suffered or died from being pulled from their mothers too early or fed improperly.
You know those memes y'all make about Tiger King? Those views you give that "documentary"? The jokes you make at the expense of their animals?
This is the type of person you are indirectly supporting.

Gatekeeping within academia needs to stop. There are many reasons some may choose not to or be unable to pursue further education. Your privilege is showing if you think not having one makes someone unqualified to speak on their area of expertise
"It tells us about a new species that we didn't realize was inhabiting central Australia. It's somewhat surprising to imagine that central Australia had rivers to support crocodiles."

Green anaconda investigating a visitor to their habitat
No joke I have answered six surrender request emails for turtles, one for a leopard gecko, and one for a bearded dragon in just the past TWO DAYS from people who impulse bought them without realizing the minimal care they require
I am beginning to get a lot of QRTs and replies from people saying "but I did it and it's fine!"
If you're doing well with your impulse pet, you are the exception NOT the rule.
So much unnecessary suffering happens to animals at the hands of impulse buyers 99% of the time.
I cannot explain just how much gender euphoria I feel when I put on this suit
Providing safe outdoor experiences for cats does wonders for their happiness and wellbeing!  Since the weather was so gorgeous, we took one of our kitties, Nigel, out to our neighborhood trail to explore

Talk about dedication! Flint is one of the most dedicated students I have ever had! They live waaaaay across the world and WAKE UP just to watch my streams. In fact, it was around 3AM when they were in class with us!
Dehydrated rotifers, penis fencing flatworms, and burger eating tapeworms... oh my.

To those of you reading this and thinking "say whaaat?", hop on over to this article to learn more!
It's #AmphibianWeek!   Many amphibians have AMAZING adaptations and the wood frog is NO exception. To survive the Canadian winter, they FREEZE! Their heart even stops beating! But, thanks to a special "anti-freeze" in their blood - they awaken in the spring unharmed.
I have lived this moment so many times and everytime I am sure the employees think I am crazy. Not specifically with sardines and turtles... but with brisket and tigers or quail eggs and lizards
Imagining how this little one traveled ALLLLL the way from a sunny farm in Florida or, even further, to Canada is so amazing. He now has a home with us and will be used to educate others about the impact of invasive species.
Cuban tree frogs represent a growing problem in warmer areas such as Florida. They are North America's largest tree frog species who, once established, can outcompete native species. The American green tree frog and the squirrel treefrog are rapidly disappearing because of them.
A little hitchhiker just arrived at my zoo!  While shopping at a plant store, a couple found this little Cuban tree frog and brought him to us. This species is native to Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands but is known to spread outside of their range via plant shipments.
Dinner time for Jafar the Carpet Python!
I gift to you one Friday blep
The tongues of lizards, like Friday the Asian Water Monitor, are split to better detect and interpret smells! It's an amazing tool to help navigate and understand their environment as well as find a yummy meal
Zambucca will be missed by so many. Sending lots of warm, good vibes to my Toronto Zoo colleagues today
Why are these boa constrictors always so CUTE? Anytime I walk past their habitat they're doing something that makes me smile. Here's all of them chilling in a bath together!
Curious what he looked like upon intake? See below!
Look who was so eager for their meal today!  This little beardie, surrendered from a private owner, is currently being rehabilitated after a severe case of malnutrition and metabolic bone disease. No more force feeding for him - he finally has the energy to eat on his own!

Tag Your Reptile Day sounds like a weird social media phenomenon  Interesting read about Florida's latest possible solution to the growing problem of invasive species in the state.
Currently losing my mind over how goofy this sand boa looks.
Interested in reading the story of how two Boa constrictors were found abandoned on our doorstep the day before Christmas Eve? You can find the start of the thread here!
Where there is darkness, there is always light. We may not have been able to save the skinniest of the Christmas boas but her friend is still hanging on and has improved greatly! His wounds are healing, he eats every feeding, he takes baths, and he has lots of energy!
I ask everyone to please be kind to your friends who do not live in the United States. While many in the states already have their second shot, many outside are still waiting for their first. The despair is high and your friends elsewhere need your support now more than ever.
After several months of unknowns, I am relieved to share that I was FINALLY able to book a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. It is a great feeling but I cannot help thinking about everyone who is still waiting for theirs. Thanks to
@/VaxHuntersCan
 for helping us navigate this chaos.
This is the first time I have EVER been able to capture our two American Alligators, Lou and Toothless, bellowing to each other! Usually, they stop whenever I get close. I like to think they're shy
ALLIGATOR DUET!  When love is in the air, gators use bellows to communicate to mates. The amazing part? What you're hearing isn't all of it! They also produce calls that we can't hear but... can SEE! The water droplets dancing on their backs are caused by these infrasounds!

Our previous method involved manual lookup of attendee info, and paws can only type thousands of names so quickly!

Pre-Registered attendees;
Starting tomorrow, you should receive an email containing a QR code for your registration.
Have this and a valid form of I.D. available at the line- you can  have the email open, have a screenshot saved, or even print it out!
Reminder that all bidders must register at the Art Show Office and be issued a bidder number!

We request that attendees please use the escalators responsibly. Excessive weight and acrobatics performed on the handrails are a primary cause of breakdowns - which will not be repaired until MFF is over.

Listen, MFF Social Media Team here AGAIN to talk about business casual. Just pretend you're boring people. Like, RP as a business traveler here for a business convention. Until Wednesday night. Please? We good?
*sighs*  Your MFF Social Media team now realizes that our tweet about pants being part of business casual was made with the mistaken assumption that attendees would also be wearing shirts with them. We regret the error.
Your MFF Social Media Team would like to apologize for any uncertainty with regards to our previous tweet, but would like to clarify that business casual does indeed still include pants.
To our early attendees; Please keep in mind that until 7PM Wednesday, we are sharing the Hyatt with business guests. The Hyatt has always been accommodating and respectful to us, so please help us return that respect and maintain a "business casual" atmosphere until then.

E-mail confirmations for movement of con-block room reservations to our new dates have been going out.  Be sure to check the email you originally used when reserving your room, including any bulk mail folders.
For now, one should operate under the assumption masks will be required in public spaces, and vaccination will be required for travel and attendance.
Vaccine eligibility is expanding across the country. We highly encourage you to get vaccinated when able. Doing so may be required for travel, hotel check-in, attendance for a variety of events in the future. Getting your vaccine will ensure you're prepared and protected.
Please wait at least a couple weeks before attempting to book an off-block room for our new dates. In order to allow time to move all con-block reservations, any attempts to book off-block right now will just yield "sold out" results.

You currently may not change your reservation to our new dates, or book new ones on our new dates, *precisely because they are holding all rooms and inventory for the migration, as well as dealing with current casino closures*.  Be patient and understanding.  Thank you!
If you have an off-block reservation, please also wait a few weeks at least before trying to call the GSR to move your reservation. Rooms will be available in October, but they are far too busy to make reservation changes right now. Attempt to make changes online if able.

@/BLFC_Bear
,
@/BLFC_Mutt
,
@/BLFC_serg
, and
@/BLFC_Yeen
 are being quiet today.
Too quiet.
They're up to something
What to do about them is the question. Some thought and planning is needed.
But in the meantime...
Adventurers, what are you going to do?
With BLFC 2019 approaching, just what are these four troublemakers up to?

@/BLFC_serg
@/BLFC_Mutt
Thinking of buyin' a room reservation off a scalper?
*smacks your hand away*
Don't! Doing so could result in losing your room, and your money! With a scalped room, all that's guaranteed is you'll pay way too much money, for way too much risk and uncertainty.
Group 2 entries begin December 17th!
Thank you all for entering, and for joining us on our 2019 campaign!
Remember, you are under no obligation to use the booking link. You may hand it off to someone else, but they will see all of your personal info, so please be cautious. All unused rooms roll over to the next wave.
Everyone who entered the room drawing will get an email declaring if you were selected or not. Emails are still going out, so please hold tight while everybody gets notified.
For those that got in, the site has been updated to reflect that.
For those who were selected for a room, the site is experiencing an issue. Please bear with us while a fix is coming. Our apologies for the delay.
[enter the room drawing] for initiative!
Reminder that the entry period for the Group 1 room drawing ends on December 9th!
Do you wish to run a panel?
Event submissions are now open!
Adventurers, you notice something on the tavern wall.
Upon approaching the wall, you see a fading poster of a wandering minstrel performance from a weekend long past.
It falls to the ground.
The now empty wall could use some more timely events...
Adventurers, Group 1 of the hotel room drawing is still accepting entrants until December 9th.
- Group 2 signups begin Dec 17th.
- Booking period for those selected in the drawing runs Dec 10-16.
...
9th!
Group 1 signups will run until December 9th ^.^
- You are not required to purchase your badge to reserve a room.
- Those selected in Group 1 will have from Dec 3 to Dec 9 to reserve their room.
Alas, we didn't roll what we needed to get things online today. Our aim is to now get the room draw entry and reg stuff online Tuesday evening.  In the meantime, assemble your spell components and party to try again tomorrow!
Also... any healers around? >.>

Should note that on the website are the credits for the vocals and participants on the CD that was sold and not the live show which had some cast that was different.
So... How many of you liked the musical!?
If you haven't already, why not take a moment to acknowledge all the people who made it possible!
The credits has people I didn't even think would contribute. So many people...

Because this adds complexity I can't ALWAYS promise the comic will update at midnight precisely. Some days, pages will just have to be done when they're done. Sometimes I'll swap or bump pages from other comics depending on what's in the pipeline.

@/KaeEsrial

As a note, Monday's comic is gonna retroactively become To Be Continued to make way for guest week. It won't change anything story-wise!
A reminder!
Drew this in response to today's

. Tarot is gonna make sure Peanut does not put on the bag and become a magical girl.
BTW If you have any guest strips, it would be a good time to send them to housepetscomic at gmail dot com. You have more than a week!
