Why? Because you will have to live your life a someone else sees fit.

The way this conversation has gone so far is that you said people should have unobstructed access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I said poor kids don't get this because of, among other things, lack of safe housing.
When the words promising us Life Liberty and the pursuit of happiness were written, they were not written only for those who were alive in that day, but they were written for future generations, all of whom were unborn.
The Constitution does not give the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to a fetus but it does to living human beings outside the womb.  Guns kill people including children.  Four lives were just lost and yet you haven't said squat.

Not eat the ones that talk - they have aspirations. Because Good values sentient life. That is the whole of it. You can still be chaotic—but the chaos would be more likely to be channeled into art, or some other creative pursuit. Your boyfriend will appreciate such hard work!
Abortion isn't that black and white. The issue really is how much should society infringe a woman's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to protect those rights of the unborn child.
Some complaints from a few people on how small trials tend to be in rare diseases, suggesting they wish they were bigger, so they could have gotten spots in high demand trials (surprised me).

Leaves me wondering if that’s a pursuit for early access to medication (I think so).

Guns are NOT a problem so this pursuit makes you look ridiculous.  I don’t have guns and they don’t get a second of consideration in my long list of worries so seeing you present guns as a problem is a stain on your reputation. We have bigger problems, waaaay bigger.

my cousin is engaged to a furry and I refuse to him her fiancé. I prefer to call him her furbaby.
Seems like a good plan. Really shows people that being a furry isn’t a personality it’s a hobby. A second channel dedicated to furry stuff would be the best option. Am proud of you

Actual furry! Not a drill!

Listen. That pic I posted earlier was the first furry art I've every drawn and I drew and erased that snout about 100 times. If I can make something that looks half decent, I know you can make something 1000 times better.

You need to shame him for being a furry. Early and often, maybe you can save him from a horrible fate.

And about what all of you saw that I've accidentally exposed his top secret location & his street address shown right here on Twitter. Don't worry, every furry YouTuber keeps their address a secret. Hope all of you are going to have a good time celebrating my birthday.
Happy December everyone! 2021 is almost over, the year we've done had been ups & downs. I've witnessed #FoldsOfHonorQuikTrip500 returns with the fans in the stands. To the day my number 1 furry crush Tilt Longtail broke up with me that changed the course of history forever.

I mean I've seen some furry artists and would love to get a commission. But Bulgarian AK's that are milled are not cheap.
Being a furry is so based and awesome tho
Just say "furry convention". They've heard it before. At least at the Canada/US border I've had someone be _curious_ about it, but you're likelier to encounter hostility by seeming evasive than you are by just answering the question.

In cultural context, same-sex marriage would have been unacceptable because it would violate patriarchal gender norms. Jesus points us beyond these divisions and toward gender equality. Since that patriarchal logic shouldn’t apply to Christians, we can affirm LGBTQ relationships.

To win or lose, succeed or fail, is sometimes not as important as trying and giving our best despite all the challenges that befall us. Life does not allow us to consistently control outcomes but we can control our efforts. That means something.

Growth comes in many forms. Some may need to retract. Some may need more support or more space. Regardless of what this year has been for you, find the strength to move forward. Grow. Be that better person you idolize and wanna be.

Wanna know why you should appreciate nice and good people. Because it takes far more effort to be nice than nasty. So when someone is being nice to you, just remember they are making an effort to be nice to you. Nasty toxic people don't make an effort.
If you put your mind  to it, you can accomplish anything !
In this hard times optimist and empathy  gonna lead us to a better tomorrow!

True love doesnt mean you have a perfect, effortless relationship

True love means that despite no matter how hard things get, no matter how much you fight, no matter how many problems you have, you work through it at and at the end of the day you still love your partner the same
this is adorable
@Kurtt_Wuff
 I wonder where Kurtt got the idea for his fursona's colors? Those are the most beautiful colors I've ever witnessed.
Everything is clear in the rear view mirror,only love make everything fits, singing your song make me feel alive because you are part of me, we own the night full of stars , at your side the road is the great adventure i will dare to furrow

In life there are times that you have to make decisions and take paths, be the right ones or not, you have to dare to take the step, it might be a long trip and full of obstacles. Keep going,  exploring, living experiences, growing with the right company & nothing will stop you!!

Never forget that your emotions are what make you strong. Take aim of them, focus and learn to harness your emotions. Don’t let them control you and don’t let them decide your actions but use them to better guide your decisions.

Currently mailing a letter only costs .55 cents. Do you want to be paying $5 for that? Do you want to have unregulated rates for shipping? Do you want to pay a fortune to ship internationally? $200 shipping for a $5 item on wish sound sexy to you?
I don’t know who needs to hear this but rest is not a reward. You don’t have to earn rest. You need rest. You deserve rest. You are worthy of rest simply because you are a living being. And don’t ever feel guilty for taking time to rest.

Thank you.

Heading onward to new horizons.
So, it's the new year. 2019 was really interesting, to say the least. some of the highest highs I've ever had, and my lowest lows. It was one hell of a roller coaster for me, but ultimately it led to me bettering myself and learning how to cope with certain things, y'know?

>
why has nobody made a VR game where you dual with lightsabers. that would be so cool.

I WOULD BUY THAT.
Fiiiiinally back home after a really fun weekend in the city!
It's a new year!!!

I have a lot of plans, aspirations and things I want to do this year, and i'm excited to get to actually doing them! Buuuuut i'm super tired so i'm going to have some TEA FIRST then sleep!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

i just spent SO LONG working on my new gal's little redesign/touch up, i'm so happy with it! i spent like 6 hours on it LMAO
I found ghost pepper chips in the grocery store today.

I'm currently eating ghost pepper chips.

they taste like pain. like hurt. like they found the recipe for "AH FUCK" and put it on these chips. but i keep eating them. i can't STOP. I LOVE THE SPICE.
For reference this is about my character Lotus who I want made into a suit. She’s primarily black, but I’m currently adjusting her design to be more fursuit friendly and wondering if a dark grey is better than black for her primary colour!

Any advice helps, thank you!
Question for suit makers and artists:

In reference to a fursuit - when you’re dealing with a darker coloured character, should black fur be avoided? Should I make my black a dark grey instead? Or is black okay?

Just figuring some stuff out for my new gal who I want as a suit!
It’s exactly TWO WEEKS away until my birthday!!
There’s a tiger in the grass!  Happy #FursuitFriday

VRChat&Fursuit parts Update ~Currently working hard on completing my queue before opening more commissions. Sorry for the inconvenience. I will make tweet post & telegram channel(Pin tweet)For Updates! Got a few more fursuit projects to finish up & recolors! Hope to open soon! :)
Anyone find it strange in real life when I'm out visiting friends when I could back in the days before covid. I don't really make direct eye contact and still have a conversation. Now in VR I still do the same . Not having eye contact but in reality cant see where my eyes at xD
Who wants some paws???  #dailyDHC get them in the link below!

Can't seem to have proper sleep the past few days. Keep waking up  My mind won't stop thinking. Nothing bad. Seems my mind feels it's awake like a normal day schedule. I feel tried but can fall back asleep and also having mild sleep apnea doesn't help either. Aaaaaaaaaaa lol

Good news! My mother is no long showing any more symptoms. We have a specialist  going with us step by step on what to do. My mother no longer in quarantine & feeling back to normal as so as my other parts of the family as well recovered. I am so relieved & not stressing any more
Another confirm case  but this time from my mother who I live with. We are taking precaution and keeping distance. I'm going out getting tested to be safe by next week when they open for the drive-thru test. This is really stressing me out. Please stay safe out there.
It’s definitely not as warm as it was in Pawaii here at #AnthroNorthwest2019 but Ruff is still in the island mood.

Sadly to say that I am canceling FE2020 and donating my reg.  I was looking forward to this con and been trying to go for many years. Lot of friends and family are worried for my heath and recommend me to stay. I can always try for next years.
Unsure to attend FE and donate my registration and go next year's. I'm keeping an eye out if things get worse. I'll decide on Sunday or Monday if I'm going or not.
Reminder, we are still taking applications for the fursuot charity dance auction.

Slots this year are limited and we are closing submissions on April 20th.

To those who have already replied, you may expect an answer soon.

Apply here:
Feeling better today finally. So much sleeping & medication. I have lot of work to catch up too!  Now I can continue what I love to do. Make paws and other fursuit parts. Thinking after BLFC. Want to work on bigger projects & make full suits & limit paws. So I can work on both :)
I'm thinking I'm getting more sick. Taking medication and vitamins to feel better before it gets worse. It's slowly creeping on me. I don't want con crud again Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I want to make awesome paws.
It was great meeting

This con hahaha...legit! ANW is good ish XD
From the call today and the damage is not fixable it seems. I had that Pathfinder for a good 7 years and also just payed it off a few months back with new tires, brakes and rotor, battery, oil change, renew license plates, new timing center. Feels all that went to waste
Welp my car is a totaled loss. Got the call from the car repaired, Rip.  Now got to wait for updates later from the insurance.
Made it back home Zzz. Time to sleep and wait for next week for MFF! :)
Good bye #ANW2019 It's been so fun! Hope to be there next year!
Ahhh! I love these behind-the-scenes photos where I'm doing the thing. :D Trying out a new technique, I'm excited!

If I had a second fursona. What would I be?
I have a pare of orange fur with pink pads I made accidentally. Any one would be interested of getting all orange indoor paws or with a different color with orange bottom fur indoor paws? :) DM me for more information or questions.
What do you guys recommend? For my work live streams. picartoTv or twitchTv?
I can't decide lol. I also wanting to play my music at the same time. I know twitch is very distracted about copyright music. I'm not sure about picarto.
Pink pads wip

Thinking of doing some live streams wile I work on fursuit making in the week and maybe some gaming on the weekends? What do you guys think? :) or just gaming on the weekends? :3
Thinking of doing MFF paw deliveries again for this year. How I got my room set :) would anyone be interested to commission paws and have them delivered at the con? Only vote if your interested for paws.

 hanging out with our adorable cria
It's almost spoopy month, decided to start early with a pic of Chip and Ash :3
I love how every time I look at twitter I am reminded of why I try not to look at twitter.
:D it me
I've been adding so much more details to Izzy's mane compared to when I drew her for the very first time!

Also my facial expressions have gotten better! o3o
WHY?!
We may or may not be at mff this year do to some other obligations that just came up. I will keep everyone posted but I do still want to get moving on this project
I am thinking about trying to film season 2 of the fandom at some point in this coming year. Would anyone be interested in chatting at MFF or TFF this year?
I just  want you all to know that I am finding my way again, that I am sorry its taken so long and that I love you all so much. Thank YOU for making this journey a magical one.
Since releasing it I fell into a depression. One that I have only been able to peak out of a few times since. The more visible I got the harder it was for me to be me. In so many ways I have just withdrawn from everything.
Hey so I just wanted to say something because I feel like it needs to be said. When we released the fandom it was a project that was a labor of love for our small team. Going through that experience took an incredible toll on myself in almost every facet of my life.
Heyo just a reminder to everyone I am still taking a break from social media and really only check this account in the morning. I just dont have the energy to deal with stuff these days

Finally! #Twilight is done!

I’m pretty happy with it! I put so much effort in this #edit and I really hope you like it
Now the mane 6 are all done!

#mlp #mlpg5 #MyLittlePonyANewGeneration #fanart
So I will be attending MFF assuming work doesn't eat up all my free time but it will probably be a pretty low key con for me because I haven't had a relax con since like a year before the pandemic.
I wish we could attend BLFC but life is too busy atm. Looking forward to seeing all you amazing folks soon.

If you thought the wild west was only a place straight white cis-men could go to shoot their little guns and spit wherever they wanted, think again.
@TenaciousRanch
 is yelling “GIT” to that narrative by offering a rural safe haven for queer and trans people to work and live.
I will be getting surgery on the 23rd and will be a little out of it for a week or so. Just transition stuff nothing to worry about.
I’m watching the fandom: a furry documentary while doodling and the sense of community just;; makes me teary

Not sad by any means but just. Hearing people talk about finding their sense of belonging in the early days really speaks to me

Indigenous Māori people from New Zealand likely discovered Antarctica 1,000+ years before Europeans reached it in the 18th century, says a new study.

Researchers, making use of oral history, say Māori and Polynesian explorers likely reached it as early as the 7th century.

 The Day You Became a Furry

Today I am joined by my friend Porter, and we are checking out possibly the darkest and most surreal furry animation I have ever seen!!
 https://bit.ly/3aLa8qE
Made some fanart of
@AshCoyote
 today!! Her happy and positive videos have been helping me stay sane and calm in this crappy pandemic, so I just wanted to say thank you~

Hello all! Ash's Social Media Manager here! I thought I'd share some fun facts about me to help introduce myself
- I've been in the furry fandom for over 10 years!
- I'm a trans, non-binary person (He/They pronouns)
- My favourite animals are African Wild Dogs
Starting now my account is being handled by my social media manager. Lots of love everyone! See you on youtube ^_^
I might be trans.
I have received a few messages about unfollowing folks accounts, this is apart of preparing this account for business and handing it off to my social media manager.

#furry #furryart #furrydrawing
I watched that documentary “Hero” that
@AshCoyote
 made!

First of all, it’s a wonderful watch, would recommend!

Second of all,
@WaggeryCos
 is super impressive to me! If you’re in the market for a suit don’t sleep on them!!
As of Monday I will no longer be actively using this account for social. It will be managed by a third party for business related to my channel. I came to this decision due to a lot of struggles that I have had with my mental health over the past year.
How to photograph yourself for YouTube lol
DAT FACE THO
Just watched "Hero" by
@AshCoyote
 Really touching. Great job to the
@WaggeryCos
 team and film production team. As a fursuit maker and someone who's watched my mom battle illness as well its really inspired me. I hope you have a speedy recovery

 WOW!!! Congratulations

Freedom of Speech ≠ Freedom from Consequences
Furry sponsored classroom field trips to benefit wildlife education /conservation should totally be a thing
Artists should be paid for their work. “Exposure” is not payment and doesn’t put food on an artist’s table nor will it pay their rent or bills.

RI furs admin here. We’re postponing all meets as well. I’m so sorry that happened to you, and surely says something about the current admins. If you need anything or even just to vent don’t hesitate to reach out.
Maine Furs admin here. We put a stop to all of our meets (furbowl, swimming, etc.) due to the pandemic. It's actual lives and health of those around us at stake, not just a popularity contest. I'm sorry you were kicked for doing the right thing. Keep protecting those you care for
Practically all of MA in in shut down. They are fools to think this is no big deal and they should stop any meets. And people should be more sensible and not attend even if they were being held.
Hey!

I am the owner of my own community groups! The admin team and myself have postponed all our monthly meetups until further notice! Though this community is heckin' great! We plan to all meet up in VRChat and run community contests until this pandemic is taken care of!
Folks, with Covid-19 happening and the CDC recommendation of no groups larger than 50, attending Furmeets and Furbowls should be put off till this global crisis is over. It’s an unpopular idea for many but it’s about being a responsible adult and keeping others safe.
Convention Organizers - if you are delaying or canceling your convention, drop us a DM and we’ll happily get the information out to our followers.
Furries. Cons are doing everything they can with this situation. Please be nice to their staff. They're people too and are stressed, just like the rest of us.
“The most important lesson I learned from Furry Fiesta is that just because a group of people are marginalized because of their kink, that doesn’t mean they don’t have a culture and vibrancy of their own.”
ATTENTION:

It is with great sadness that we must cancel our 2020 convention until further notice on the advice of both health officials and business partners. Our attendees’ next steps are our priority and we want to make sure you’re informed. Read more: https://furnalequinox.com/2020/03/13/furnal-equinox-2020-cancellation/…

#PrEP #truvada
And finally to prevent drama such as this, consider Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) such as Truvada.  You take one pill, once a day.  It’s 92% - 99% effective in prevention of HIV transmission.  Most can get the drug for low to no cost.
Disclosing someone’s HIV status online is considered the same as DOXing them, may violate state laws and violates HIPPA, and opens you up to both criminal and civil charges
If you are sexually active, you should test for HIV every 6 months at minimum, and for other STIs even more frequently if you do not use protection.
If someone is HIV positive and is on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), and their viral load becomes undetectable, they can not transmit the disease to someone else.
If you are unsure of your partner’s status, ask.  In many states, you must disclose your HIV status if asked.  You are responsible for your own health.  Take that responsibility seriously
Seems there is an uproar about HIV infection going on. First, as a former CDC employee, I can say, unless there is large scale outbreak, HIV is dealt with by local Infectious Disease Specialists, and local Health Departments, not a team from the CDC

  Thank you for taking the time to treat Furries with a shred of dignity in your latest (and hopefully not final) episode.  Drew lots of parallels between it and CSI Fur and Loathing but in a good way!

There is a furry convention at the casino where we had Mother’s Day brunch. My daughter said “I would rather hang with these people 100x over than a room full of conservative Christians”. Smart kid I’ve raised.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

Thanks to each and every one of you who have shown your support to Emma and her family.

We had over 40 suiters come out for her photo shoot. Many of whom stayed afterwards to interact and play with Emma and the other kids.

Relationships are hard. Work on your relationships every day. It takes communications, understanding, and lots of love. The pain can be immeasurable, as can the pleasure. And then there is the warm feeling of love you carry with you. Always worth it in the end

He was a good fur.  His name was Kimbalion. He was cute as heck. Smart. Energetic. Adventurous. He loved rollerblading. I knew him since the 90s but we’d lost touch over the last few years. And now he’s gone. A friend stopped running today.

I encourage any artist to block people who openly believe art doesn't need credit. Keep your work safe from those who are fine with stealing your hard work and distributing it, damaging your online footprint.

From Bleeding Cool -
Also, most states have statutes in place requiring license to practice law - doing so without is a crime and can land you in prison.
Good advice to any Furry Convention - have a licensed lawyer on your board, or at least a good lawyer on retainer.  It can save your con.

Interesting concept...
If buying a fursuit or art where you are spending hundreds to thousands of $$, consider using an Escrow service like http://Escrow.com
Would you be angry if a Fursuit maker claims they can't refund your money, but they can seem to afford going to conventions every 2 months?
The example contract is just that - an example.  Please check online for a contract for your state or country!
Law Depot has a great "Independent Contractor Agreement" - Example is here -https://dropbox.com/s/lwcvei36owe2mfp/Independent%20Contractor%20Agreement.pdf?dl=0… Protect yourself when buying or selling!
Should fursuit makers or artists and purchasers sign a binding purchase and sale agreement – so both parties are legally protected?
Have you ever been stiffed by an artist or fursuit maker?  Chime in and let us know!

You guys are awesome, thanks for making my work with fursuits possible, thanks for allowing me to have this job, I'm glad and lucky to meet such nice and great people!
It's getting hard and expensive to get Fur due to shipping costs +  brazilian import taxes that are 60%  of the total amount for federal taxes + 25% for state taxes and they want to raise the taxes further!
I got my BEANS from

I'm giving everything that I have right now to make the best I can including improving some little quirks on my fursuit head shapes, making a much better lining inside the head, improving ventilation, weight, ease to wear, to clean and overall durability.
Sometimes if feels like punching water and not getting anywhere, but today I'm super happy with the results and I'm much more confident to move forward with the next commissions.
Also thanks a lot for the patience of those that are still waiting on their suits from me.
The work time and patience invested to fix some little bugs on my moving jaws is finally paying off getting some nice results. It has been a challenge to make a mechanism that doesn't require screws, elastic or springs, it has been over 2 years since I draw the first ideas.

  are going to find it.
I think we finally covered and organized the house and workshop enough to be able to go back on building suits again.
So, I've decided that before I put this fursuit for auction I want to give a chance for people to get it for a solid price of $ 3000 USD + Shipping.

Head size: 22,2' -  23,2' ( 56,5 - 59 cm )
Model size : 5,8 ( 178cm ) wheight  158 lbs ( 72kg )
Maker : Furry Machine
We may put this kitty for auction later.
It's a full suit that I've done for a client here in Brazil as a commission but he couldn't afford to finish paying.
We made a deal that we can sell the suit with full rights for the fursona as well.
Just now I found out that I took this pics on the same position in two different situations with two different hobbies. Lol
So, I will enjoy it to do an fursuit vs fursuiter

He’s a fraud but I still like him. #aggretsuko #torajima
It's still a work in progress, will look much better and organized after we get everything placed.
Since we got a lot of stuff done today we could update a bit more the workshop.
Little by little we are getting all the things placed and working, we are almost done with everything.
Today I went out with my mother in law to help her to get stuff done and tomorrow I need update the bills on my name this on the new house.
Assembling new workshop at the new house.
The cats accepted the new house very well, and we finally brought all of our stuff, time to unpack everything and put some appliances working.
Bringing the left over stuff to the new house, two more trips to go yet.
Thanks everyone for the 7K followers.
Now let's look for the 8k, 9k and 10k.
Lots of traffic today.
We still have stuff left behind to bring to the new house.
Packing stuff non stop since yesterday 11 AM and it's 1:45  AM but, there's not so much to store anymore.
Very soon we will be living and working over here.

What do you get when you cross a kigurumi and a fursuit? A fleecesuit! We've created a new style that is comfy, easy to wear, affordable, and still has elements of a fullsuit (Foot/hand paws, full-sized tail). Hood with ears optional! #fursuit #furry #cosplay #fleece #twokinds

Truck drivers got what they were asking and they are going back to work little by little.

Things are slowly settleling down in Brazil.
The situation in Brazil right now is so Rough, that we can not even send people to hell because there is no gasoline to get over there.
We're currently facing a terrible crisis here in Brazil. I hope they come to an agreement fast, since many people have been and are being affected. As for myself, biggest concern is not having fuel, even if I... try to go somewhere else. Geez.
yeah... they still didin't solve the issue yet, there are a lot of truck drivers that are still on strike.  I comemorated too early. ^^'''
Good news. after 4 days of Stryke, the goverment offered one deal in exchange of 15 days of truce.
( d'ammm things worked out fast this time )
Imagine you paying $8.89 on each liter of gasoline. ( if you find) ^^'
I already got my tank full to the top in case I need.
All truck drivers in Brazil are on strike since this last monday, gas stations are running out of fuel, food stocks are low, supermarkets are running out of products, there is 40% less bus on the streets even some airports are without fuel.
I am not worthy...

The PlayStation 3 and PS Vita stores will close down in a few months. You better get the games that are going to be super hard to find because retro games will become more expensive.

I highly recommend that you get Klonoa.

We of the furry fandom will not tolerate racism in our world. There is no need for Asian hate and there are lots of Asian people in the US that have been murdered lately.

This site is very important. Please donate and spread the word. #StopAsianHate

LRT: This. If you're a minor, please be careful on how you approach certain people. Feel free to call out people if they're doing awful things like grooming.

Grown adults grooming minors is NOT okay. Pedophiles are terrible people.
Minors in this community, please remember it's not normal for grown adults to be attracted to you. They might sweet talk you and make you believe it's OK, that you're the one exception, mature for your age etc.
These are grooming techniques. They know what they're doing.

If I wanted to experience an actual con I would have to spend hundreds on passport renewal and airfare to get out of the country.
Americans have like 50 cons to choose from and here in the UK you only get 1 proper con. And that con (confuzzled) always plants itself at the end of may right in the middle of academic exam season giving a huge middle finger to anyone still studying.

Verdict not surprising. Sets a silly precedent.
Maybe its just Twitter being extremely toxic as per
Also people put way too much social value on a glorified carpet.
Being a furry is just joining after hearing about how welcoming the community is and then eventually realising over time that the community is becoming increasingly unwelcoming and open armed because of trivial things like your personal investment choices :/

The Police are pigs and the only good police officers are the ones that quit or get fired because they are good.
No no no. Media please don't do this.

*Police* killed 8-year-old Fanta Bility.

*Police* say teenagers were involved in a separate conflict blocks away and claim that's why they fired their guns.

The teenagers had no role in her death.

For once, don't buy the police narrative.

So yeah if you’re in the right sector (STEM usually) then in America it’s pretty rosey so long as you don’t have to frequent the hospital.
Oh yeah and the Tax burden is always way less in America too. Healthcare costs is the only real caveat.
Even when you have no right to time off etc with them kind of salaries if you’re in the right industry you americans never realise how much worse it is in other places. In countries like Russia I’d imagine its even worse than it is here in the UK
I got offered 17k GBP for my would be first job with a global top accounting firm in a pretty high COL area. And I have to read Americans in the field moan that their starting job “only” pays them 50k USD :V

100% serious when I say the Onion’s 9/11 coverage deserved a Pulitzer
You ever see someone you thought you were pretty chill with just unfollow you out of nowhere and spend the next hour wondering why?
Reading through and seeing how muslims and other groups of people were treated during and following 9/11 and how people blamed them for what happened is just really upsetting. Imagine being ostracised by your own teachers in front of everyone at school or something. Awful.
Paw fetish national anthem
On 9/11/73 the US supported a fascist coup in Chile against the democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende.

In most of the world, this event is known as "the 1st 9/11", but is largely unknown in the US.

Here are Allende's final words, broadcast to the nation.
I personally don't think 9/11 should continue to be a "holiday" as it currently is, because it's pretty much used as a lever of nationalism, xenophobia, islamophobia, and general hate, rather than leaving room for healing and grief.

All working hard in school with the panic and making myself sick with stress is seemingly going to get me is an underpaid, overworked and soulless office job where I’m racing to pay my extortionate rent costs at the end of the month to some cunt that was born at a better time.
My dad always told me to work hard in school and I’ll never regret it. Everyone older than me in my family said it to me actually. They told me if I work hard now I will have it all. A house, family, nice car, nice bit of cash in the bank for holidays. It was all a fucking lie.
Glad to know we’ll have to carry the burden of retiring baby boomers on our backs for most of our lives after they fucked everything up for us and made it virtually impossible to have a stable lifestyle like they had on a plate for them without some large form of gifted capital.
So young people now have to pay more from the scraps they’re given to support systems that are clogged up mostly by pensioners and baby boomers with vacation homes and 6 or 7 fig retirement funds.

Great. Really incentives us to work hard.

@FeatheryFlukes
SO. MANY. PEOPLE.

Sorry to do this again but I'm sick of seeing this guy.

This guy goes to furry cons and r***s animals. At our conventions.

He had an after dark account for his own dog that furries would flirt with.

Click on his following and look at the wall off zoophile accounts.

These are the sorts of people we should be focusing on during Pride.

A Story In 4 Parts
Photografurs
See I’m not the only one that doesn’t close tabs
Too good not to share
Fur Fandom getting excited about a fursuit "auction" going for 50 grand, which is good.

But lets remember the photographers in the fandom.

Some have paid $10,000, $20,000, $40,000 for all there camera gear and we got people saying charging for fursuit photo shoots is a wrong.
how it started // how it’s going
Aight so on this game of civilsation 6 I created a religion called furryism and now the game has decided my apostle will spread 621 points of my religion per turn xDDD
Couldn’t say why but it’s abundantly obvious to me that this pic is from the UK
It’s ironic that basically all of furry from what I can see was hellbent on seeing the demise of crypto and now someone just nuked the world record fee for a fursuit on the back of cryptocurrency gains.
I was so close to making everything better but all I could do was watch as it slipped through my fucking fingers
I just wanna be a pooltoy floating in the pool on a hot summery day. No sad. Just vibes.

I don’t really want to die. I want to fall asleep indefinitely. I’ll wake up when things prove to get better. Tired of just chugging on under the failing assumption that things will inevitably get better. Things go the other way. They don’t get better.

I fucking hate technology. Would be nice not to have to fight tooth and fucking nail to achieve some basic functionality out of things I buy.
It hasn’t felt great seeing friends and people I look up to write me off as someone that’s not morally sound or whatever words they have for people they deem to be bad. Stop pretending to be on a higher level.
Reminder that there’s nothing wrong with cryptocurrency as a whole and that you shouldn’t look down on those with stakes in the market. Not every cryptocurrency has harmful components.

Remembering the time I was new to furry and I thought crinklewag just meant a cute way of expressing excitement so I started unironically using it without knowing it had something to do with diapers.
And yes Bitcoin, ETH etc. is flawed and deserves to perish.
Also tired of the “bitcoin represents the entire crypto market” line of thinking. It’s not true at all.
Tired of people on here not understanding that there are cryptocurrencies that aren’t reliant on environmentally damaging or immoral processes.

Plushies are great and all but cuddling with real people can be so much better
Pros: Super soft. You can cuddle my tail and sleep on it or use it as a blanket. Can be squeaky if you’d like! Just be sure to watch your claws

Cons: Will eat all of your food and getting up from cuddle naps with me would be super hard. Too comfy.

Protogens...where are your factory reset buttons?
It’s sad/irritating how often popufurs fly over the handle about things and make it all about themselves and then proceed to bully smaller accounts into backing down on their opinions, deleting tweets and going private. They always make up shit they can get mad over.
Is it wrong to wish that I wasn’t asexual sometimes?
I really just want to sleep and not wake up until shit like anxiety stops making my life harder than it should be. If it doesn’t go then I simply don’t want to wake up. I don’t want to die but I’d rather just sleep indefinitely.
I need to find a new release for temporarily escaping my anxiety and self loathing. Sleep doesn’t work anymore because it steals that away from me. Stuffing my face with junk food just leaves me obese and broke which makes me more sad.

Unsettling images
It’s not all big accounts but it’s like 75% of them I’d say.
I know people only have so much capacity in terms of communication over social media but when you spend 2 minutes posting a nice message only for it to go ignored and then see them reply to any account with enough followers and a fursuit you just have to roll your eyes.
Honestly sometimes I wonder why I’m still on here. Furry Twitter kinda fucking sucks.
They’ll interact with you if you hold an opinion that doesn’t align with their own. They just won’t interact in a good way lmao. But if you try to pass a positive message or something you’ll just get ignored along with the 100 other comments from sub 1k accounts.

call me crazy but it's extremely weird that we spent an entire pandemic yelling at antivaxxers to listen to scientists and the CDC when they said to quarantine and wear masks and get vaccinated but immediately got mad when the CDC announced that the vaccines are working

My FNAF songs folder. 25 projects in the works and counting
Time to hit my lawyer up.
Here’s some behind the scenes of an upcoming music video and a little taste of the song  #notlookingtofalldown
Nothing like waking up to the soundtrack of The Nightmare Before Christmas  Happy Halloween K9’s

Hope to see you all in today’s Spooktacular Stream starting at 3PM PDT!

This month I’ve been hit with nonstop claims daily from them; claiming my own music videos for me, and I have to tell them each time again and again that I’m handling my own monetization on those videos and that I am the official artist. I hope
@DistroKid
 never pulls this
I’m curious if they have suddenly started claiming the literal thousands of reuploads that are out there now too  and why did it take 5 years to find my official music videos that have literal millions of views on the official artist channel??
I love that 5 years after I posted the music videos to my first songs,
@cdbaby
 finally found them and is suddenly copyright claiming all of them on my own channel. Only took 5 years to sift through Content ID

I feel attacked
My artistic process for my personal work is... probably not the healthiest thing for my mental state  I’m starting to think these songs are not worth feeling so horrible for.
I love this so much!!  Your style is so dope! What the hecck!! https://twitter.com/nuirrrrrr/status/1216212675639808001…

On a related note: Discovered this week that I may be allergic to some makeup products  I hope it wasn’t the Mini because this is my first pallet ever.
The Conspiracy collection is what first got me to try a bit of makeup and though I missed out on the Conspiracy pallet I adore the Mini Controversy Thank you

Hey

 could ya hit me back about my very glitchy Matriarch? It’s unusable at this point even after the new firmware update and it’s been 10 days since I emailed about it  I absolutely love this synth but these bugs are driving me crazy!
So I just opened FNAF AR for the first time and the VERY moment it said “we’ve sent Freddy over to you!” I got alerts of motion at my front door and then the doorbell rang....!

Leave your comment for the FTC about COPPA here! https://regulations.gov/comment?D=FTC-2019-0054-0001…
Please if you make a post about the FTC and COPPA, link to the .gov sites of the policy and the .gov site to leave a public comment! Let your audience have the chance to find the answers for themselves if you want to educate them!
COPPA: https://ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions…
Having spoken to my team at Frederator as well as my team of entertainment and social media lawyers in the US, video game fandom channels like mine are NOT safe from this policy change because of “content inadvertently being appealing to kids” regardless of who it was made for.
This is NOT a policy made for television so if you are getting legal advice from people in television, you are not getting the whole picture. This is COPPA, it ONLY pertains to content ONLINE. While the FTC does also govern television, this is not about TV!
While I appreciate fellow creators putting their opinions out about COPPA. Some are making videos and posts about the policy but failing to see a need to be worried, not realizing they missed the most important phrase in the policy - “content appealing to kids”

If you’ve never heard this song, check out the music video here!
I found this old patch today and now I’m feeling #nostalgic  If you remember this song, you’re an OG K9!
I can’t be the only one that does this...right?
Wow this weekend is hitting the bank account really hard. First adpocolypse 2.0, then my macbook pro gets fried by a spilled drink, then I get another two flat tires on the way to replace the laptop.  Now I can finally use that emoji properly!

I’m here at the dentist office and I’m sweating because I’m so nervous  #GotPitStains
Now I get to spend today and part of this week in dentist chairs. I am not looking forward to this
Back in 2015 I fell off my longboard and this happened. My dentist gave me a temporary fix but said the broken teeth would need to be crowned in 4 years. Last night one of the fake tooth parts just fell out while flossing. WHY JANUARY??!?
Now I have to spend the next 90 minutes playing apps and watching YouTube videos while I wait for a tow truck...I guess it’s not all bad

I absolutely love this song from yesterday’s #StevenUniverse episode  #ChangeYourMind
It’s not fun being in love with a ghost who left your life years ago  When I see her in my dreams I wake up feeling like a ghost myself. I need to write a song about this feeling.
I thought I was being super clever remotely backing my car up into the garage so I wouldn’t get rained on. As soon as it parked beside me the windshield wipers turned on and flung water all over me

Success and money do not equal happiness. You can have everything you’ve ever wanted and still feel empty. Chasing a career can seem so necessary when you’re looking toward the future but love will always be the most important. #LessonsLearnedTheHardWay

I really like Depression: the Furry TV Show
When I opened up Google today, I was a bit caught by surprise when I saw Mister Rogers in place of the Google logo. So I clicked and noticed a very well-made stop-motion music video of his beloved song "Won't You Be My Neighbor?"

It was an amazing experience!
@MisterRogersSay
K9’s, I am almost speechless right now...  I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time. Today I was able to make a dream into reality and I cannot thank everyone enough for helping make this happen!  You K9’s are so amazing!!

What is your dream car?
Do you ever file complaints against very rude customer service?
Looks like no new car today cause the dealership screwed up my loan application  I don’t like rude customer service especially when I’m being polite and they stubbornly double down on something they clearly messed up!
Buying a car is a pain in the bum. Why didn’t anyone tell me it was so complicated and takes so long?!
Never mind  They were booked up! The floof stays...for now
Time to get a trim! Or at least try to if my fav salon isn’t too busy!  The floof is too real right now!!
Today’s schedule might be too chaotic for a live stream! Something big is coming tomorrow and I’m scrambling to get ready!
BITCH HWHATTCY FFGGGG HT. HFJFJFJIFOOHGGG OH GGGG HH OHHHHH
When your Dream makes no sense
As you grow older and get more busy chasing your career, please remember take time to talk to your friends. Sometimes we forget how important friendship is. Don’t wait around for them to reach out first. Go talk to your friends. They miss you.

Using Premier on the new PC for the first time  OML it’s so much faster than my macs!
Why didn’t I switch to PC editing sooner?!
I mean it’s all going to get posted online anyways!  Maybe a bit better quality footage is scary to them???

That moment you realize that catchy hook you wrote for a friend’s song is actually already a hook in a J. Cole song...  Too bad though, it would’ve been a really sick hook.

One great but rare way to help out creators you love FOR FREE:

Contact your favorite con and ask them to invite them as a guest.

If invited, the creator might even get funding for the trip!! Or at least get a free artist alley table/con pass! It helps creators visit new places!

Sorry to keep tagging you guys
@TeamYouTube
 - but it appears most of my notified subscribers did not get any notification about our live stream that went on for over two hours today.  Getting a lot of complaints from subscribers right now.
Even your Creator Studio system shows it as a fully monetized video with no notifications anywhere about it being inappropriate for viewers. Something obviously isn’t right here.
Apparently YouTube is making it even harder for you to see new videos.

- hit the notification bell on your favorite channels as well as subscribe
- follow them in other platforms
- use your subscriber feed more than recommended
- retweet this so others see it.

Turns out I uploaded the wrong version of our new video, but I fixed it last night! Unfortunately in order to not be demonetized we have to keep it unlisted for over 24 hours  Sunday is the day everyone!! Patrons check your email later today though  #earlyaccess
Is the wait finally over tomorrow for our next song?  ...maybe... Stay notified, K9’s!
As I was watching the new YouTube Red show- “I’m Poppy!,” I was so shocked and confused. Is this show a commentary on what happened to Mars Argo??! She was one of my favorite singers... this is making me really sad
Literally just finished editing over 100 text layers and was on the end card of the video! I JUST NEED 10 SECONDS MORE!!! Now I have to redo it all!!!
Im so done with
@adobe
 After Effects. I can’t even get it to play back now. I’m at the very end of the video editing and it is totally corrupt now! Sorry everyone- “They’ll Keep You Running” is getting delayed.... Time to upgrade OSX to rebuild the entire project in Final Cut.
So I can’t figure out how to replace these lightbulbs in my house. I broke one while trying... good thing I wore gloves! Safety first!
youtube went ahead and changed their sub box to sort by ‘highlights’ instead of ‘most recent’  similar to what ig did in the past  be sure to change your settings back to most recent so you don’t miss your favourite creators videos!

If you made a video with my music and recently received a claim by Frederator - that is my MCN searching out for my content and claiming it like our music usage rules state! Not a false claim!

#DYK Flamingos have more in common with whales than other birds when it comes to feeding. That's because flamingos are filter-feeders! Complex rows of horny plates line their beaks which are used to strain food items, like crustaceans, from the water, much like baleen whales do.

 As predators and prey, snakes keep ecosystems in balance.

These past thirteen years working directly with animals has been an amazing ride. I have learned so much, lived so many amazing experiences, and worked alongside so many amazing people. But, it’s now time to put my skills to use in new ways.
As someone who grew up in a rural community, I know first hand how difficult it is for the majority of kids (and adults) to have access to these experiences. This is why I am so thrilled to be joining the team and begin work on making zoos and aquariums more accessible for all.
I believe everyone regardless of income level, location, or other factors should have the ability to meet the amazing animals we share this planet with and have the opportunity to grow into conservation heroes.
Zoolife is the world’s first virtual zoo; designed to bring guests closer to nature and offer innovative new ways of learning, protecting, and engaging with the natural world, from home. Streaming live from the world's top accredited zoos, sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers.
I am absolutely thrilled to share that I have accepted an exciting new role with

Glass frogs - a frog so transparent you don't even need an x-ray or MRI to see inside of them!
Tasmanian devils don't just exist in Looney Toons! The name for this little mammal originates from the first European settlers on the island state of Tasmania who heard mysterious growls and screams in the night.  This later encouraged the inclusion of "devil" in its.
The nearly five-inch-long tongue of a kinkajou allows them to expertly reach inside flowers or beehives for tasty honey or nectar
Aye-aye, Captain! The aye-aye is the only primate who uses a form of "echolocation".  They specifically listen for echoes to lead them to hollow areas in the trees, where they use their unusually long middle finger to hunt for insects inside the tree
Whitemargin stargazer lookin' up at ya  This species hangs out on coastal bottoms where it prefers to stay mostly buried under the sand with only their eyes showing. An oral lure hangs out to lure prey closer
This is your regular reminder that binturongs smell like buttered popcorn

The most shocking fact about mantis shrimp isn't their powerful punch. It's the fact they aren't even shrimp. They are stomatopods, distant relatives to crabs, shrimp, and lobsters.

This notoriously shy shark has a powerful secret tool - its tail. The thresher shark's tail makes up half of its body length and is used to stun its prey. By swiping their tail in a trebuchet-like motion, thresher's are able to hit fast enough to create a stunning shockwave
Meet the snake with eyelashes! The most distinguishing feature of an eyelash viper is the supraciliare, or enlarged scale, above each eye, giving the appearance of “eyelashes”. These eyelashes help the vipers blend in better with the surrounding foliage of their environment

I will personally be holding safety refreshers for all of my staff, volunteers, and interns to ensure we are prepared should (heaven forbid) this ever happen to us. To clarify, we do use all of the aforementioned safety tools and have backups, but it never hurts to be prepared!
Threatening the facility this happened at, harassing their staff, and general negativity does NOTHING to help this situation. What happened, happened. What is important is that the zoo and staff improve going forward.
It is clear the keeper messed up. It is clear safety protocols need to be reevaluated including having backup keepers on stand by so guests do not have to be involved. But, we should ABSOLUTELY recognize how this keeper was able to get herself out of this situation so easily.
That. Is. AMAZING.
Despite having her arm FULLY inside the gator’s mouth while it death rolls her in the water, the keeper still remains calm enough to instruct a guest to assist her. She walks the bystander completely through how to help her and later help himself out of the habitat.
Most people would scream and try to pull away from the gator. That’s not what this keeper did. Instead, she jumped into the water WITH THE GATOR, locked legs around it, and rolled with it. THIS takes guts and nerves of steel which was amazing to witness. This move saved her arm.
It only takes one moment of complacency where you are a TAD too comfortable for a mistake to happen with any animal. The keeper reached too close to the gator’s face to ask it to back up when the gator was already in a feeding response. We all know what happened next.
In this situation, none of these tools were being used - only hands and the keeper’s body. This particular training method has worked for them for a very long time. But, of course, that doesn’t mean it will always go smoothly - as indicated by the video floating around.
The wooden poles are used to guide the animal through gentle pressure on the tip of their snouts or on other areas. Target sticks serve as a visual cue to tell the animal where you want them to go. You can also teach alligators to station, come, and more through verbal commands.
Typically, when working with large crocodilians, multiple tools are utilized to ensure the safety of the zookeeper as well as to communicate effectively with the animal. This usually involves wooden poles, target sticks, and related devices.
Gators are capable of being trained to respond to verbal & visual cues. This form of training, often referred to as husbandry training, enables keepers to work safely with dangerous animals while minimizing the stress an animal may have during routines such as veterinary exams.
News has spread regarding a keeper in Utah who was bitten by an alligator they care for. While it is clear the keeper made a mistake & the facility's safety protocols need to be reevaluated, the keeper’s capability in the face of immense peril should be commended.

Here’s why
There are currently 201 known adult kakapos left in the world - each with their own name. All of them have been named by the Kakapo Recovery Program which extensively monitors the critically endangered birds. That's a BIG increase from 1995 when there were only 51 birds left.

Mmmm... tasty slug snack.

NOT REALLY THOUGH!

Banana slugs defend themselves by producing A LOT of mucus, causing their predators' mouths to be filled with GOOP. The goop is also an anesthetic, meaning it will make a predator's tongue and throat go numb

Velvet Ants, known as "Cow Killers", are actually parasitoid wasps. They get their name from the urban legend that their string is so painful it is able to kill a cow.
Known as the King of the cattail, male red-winged blackbirds will not hesitate to divebomb larger predators or even other birds. More than a quarter of each day is spent chasing off or at least pestering perceived threats.

Meet the polka-dot tree frog. Secretions along the frog's skin cause it to emit a greenish blue fluorescent glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. Because it is linked to secretions from glands in the skin, they can also leave fluorescent markings as they move
Although most people believe black mambas get their name from the color of their bodies, the name is actually because of the inside of their mouths. When threatened, the snake is quick to draw back into a striking position, and open the mouth to expose the black interior.

One of the activities involved learned how to setup a habitat for a reptile, like this little leopard gecko. The kids had so much fun decorating for him!

Amphibians and reptiles are slipping away faster than we can study them... or even teach about them

What a beautiful sheen!  This gorgeous dwarf reticulated python was surrendered to us a few months ago. Despite her smaller size, she still has just as fierce of a personality as her larger counterparts!

Bindi is a crocodile monitor who came to us through a government confiscation a few years ago. The species is shy and aggressive by nature, with these characteristics compounded in Bindi due to her background.

She gets better every day though under our care!

THANK YOU!

It has been SO disheartening today to see so many people belittling the sustainable actions we can take in our daily lives.

This isn't an either/or situation.

We should do everything we can to save our planet - the small and the big.
Fossil fuels are burning up our future. We need to make it clear to these corporations that sustainable, renewable energy sources are what we and this planet need.

It's not just Thailand going through this. The zoological based tourism industry around the world is suffering more than you may think. Accredited zoos, historic aquariums, privately owned ventures... We risk losing them more and more without increased financial support

P.S. Don't think that we don't notice those of you that are now tweeting "Happy Pride" as if a few weeks ago you weren't talking about how it was cringe  Funny how some of you start singing a different tune when it is now advantageous to you, huh?
As someone who grew up in a very close-minded and homophobic town, pride is a very much needed celebration. This is the one time of year a lot of us finally feel comfortable to be ourselves.

It is not cringe.

It is not stupid.

Anyone have any Twitch team recommendations? I have been working on being a part of Wild Abandon but was not able to get an application in quick enough for either of their openings. Feeling really discouraged and hope there may be some alternatives out there to help me grow.
Although this particular sign is not government issued nor official, the text in the bill is still just as bad. This is one of the most absurd things I have ever heard of or seen. Pictured here is what the "official" signage is most likely to look like.
Tennessee businesses who allow patrons to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity are now being forced to display discriminatory signs to "warn" others they may see trans people inside. All in thanks to HB 1182. This is disgusting.

I know I have angered people in the past about this. I have been called a fun ruiner or been told "you must be fun at parties".

I don't care what you think of me.

I will call out abuse as I see it.

Please stop reposting content from terrible, abusive facilities.
I don't what it is but furries are particularly bad with this. So many think "Aww, Cute!" and post without thinking about where the video was taken or at what context. Even if you are ripping the photo/video and reposting it "as your own", you are supporting them.
Anytime you repost, like, share, or interact in anyway with the content created by these Tiger King stars you are supporting this abuse.

STOP giving them the attention and support.

STOP perpetuating this suffering.
Since September 2020, the Department of Justice reports AT LEAST three big cat cubs died of malnutrition and two others died under "suspcious circumstances". The remainder are said to have suffered or died from being pulled from their mothers too early or fed improperly.
You know those memes y'all make about Tiger King? Those views you give that "documentary"? The jokes you make at the expense of their animals?

This is the type of person you are indirectly supporting.

No joke I have answered six surrender request emails for turtles, one for a leopard gecko, and one for a bearded dragon in just the past TWO DAYS from people who impulse bought them without realizing the minimal care they require
I am beginning to get a lot of QRTs and replies from people saying "but I did it and it's fine!"

If you're doing well with your impulse pet, you are the exception NOT the rule.

So much unnecessary suffering happens to animals at the hands of impulse buyers 99% of the time.
I cannot explain just how much gender euphoria I feel when I put on this suit
Providing safe outdoor experiences for cats does wonders for their happiness and wellbeing!  Since the weather was so gorgeous, we took one of our kitties, Nigel, out to our neighborhood trail to explore

Imagining how this little one traveled ALLLLL the way from a sunny farm in Florida or, even further, to Canada is so amazing. He now has a home with us and will be used to educate others about the impact of invasive species.
Cuban tree frogs represent a growing problem in warmer areas such as Florida. They are North America's largest tree frog species who, once established, can outcompete native species. The American green tree frog and the squirrel treefrog are rapidly disappearing because of them.
A little hitchhiker just arrived at my zoo!  While shopping at a plant store, a couple found this little Cuban tree frog and brought him to us. This species is native to Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands but is known to spread outside of their range via plant shipments.

Interested in reading the story of how two Boa constrictors were found abandoned on our doorstep the day before Christmas Eve? You can find the start of the thread here!
Where there is darkness, there is always light. We may not have been able to save the skinniest of the Christmas boas but her friend is still hanging on and has improved greatly! His wounds are healing, he eats every feeding, he takes baths, and he has lots of energy!
Update: I am very sad to share that we made the difficult decision to euthanize the skinniest of the two Christmas boas last month. She was showing no signs of improvement and began to decline, including no interest in eating. We tried our hardest. She passed peacefully.
To put some perspective to the situation in Canada right now: I am an essential worker living in a hot spot. I only JUST became eligible to book a vaccine at 8AM this morning. I get my first dose of the vaccine next week but don't get my second dose until the end of AUGUST.
I ask everyone to please be kind to your friends who do not live in the United States. While many in the states already have their second shot, many outside are still waiting for their first. The despair is high and your friends elsewhere need your support now more than ever.
After several months of unknowns, I am relieved to share that I was FINALLY able to book a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. It is a great feeling but I cannot help thinking about everyone who is still waiting for theirs. Thanks to
@VaxHuntersCan
 for helping us navigate this chaos.
This is the first time I have EVER been able to capture our two American Alligators, Lou and Toothless, bellowing to each other! Usually, they stop whenever I get close. I like to think they're shy
ALLIGATOR DUET!  When love is in the air, gators use bellows to communicate to mates. The amazing part? What you're hearing isn't all of it! They also produce calls that we can't hear but... can SEE! The water droplets dancing on their backs are caused by these infrasounds!

Happy #FurFestFriday! The key to winning some games is eye contact, and focus. #FursuitFriday
Hey Y'all. Who else(besides me) in the fandom are mental health therapists? I'm creating a list of contacts for my work as Mental Health/Spirituality/Nature track lead for
@FurFest
.  Please share this tweet! DM's are open.
It's #TipTuesday and many have recognized the delayed start to registration this year. Responding to attendee feedback, we have been hard at work revamping our opening process and do not have dates for you yet. We appreciate your patience and ask that you check back next Tuesday!
Happy #FurFestFriday! We love our charities dearly and are curious to hear your favorite memories of them. What about your favorite fundraising methods? Your favorite fundraising critters?
Happy #TipTuesday! We do not have any dates for you this week, but volunteers are making progress and our 2019 website has been updated. For those who wish to apply as Dealers, please take a moment to read over the relevant FAQ found there: http://ow.ly/bLpn50uHf9u
Happy #FurFestFriday! Don't feel blue!  MFF is months and months away, but we suspect it will be here before you realize it!
Happy #TipTuesday! We do not have any dates for you this week.  Our volunteers from Dealers, Registration, Hotel and more, are hard at work to open this year's departments as soon as possible.
Hey
@FurFest
 digging through old things, thought you might get a kick out of this.
Happy #FurFestFriday! Did you see we had full sized video games last year?  How frickin' awesome is that?!? (Note: "Full-sized" is relative to the size of the machines, not the size of the furs playing them.)
And just to clarify, we do not have any dates for you this week.  Our Dealers, Registration, Hotel, etc. volunteers are hard at work to open this year's departments as soon as possible.
You're welcome!
Many people are excited about this year's event, and worried about missing a major announcement. Moving forward, we'd like to help out by setting aside #TipTuesday for all special deadline-related announcements. So if you only check our posts once each week, Tuesday is the day!
Happy #FurFestFriday! Do you love video games?  Why not check out our video gaming this year and show off your skills, while making friends who share your passion!
From all your friends at Midwest FurFest, we hope you have a safe and meaningful Memorial Day.
Happy #FurFestFriday! From A/V, to DJ's, to programming and hotel staff, it takes a surprising amount of time and effort to make our dances come together. We hope you enjoy the heck out of 'em!
Happy #FurFestFriday! TFW: Somebody else is getting all the attention, just because they don't know how stringed lights work... #FurSuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! With seven months until MFF 2019, who are you excited to see?!  #FursuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! Nightly dances are a great way to celebrate life, friends, and the fandom as a whole.
MFF Social Media Team here! Convention Registration and Hotel Reservations are still busy finalizing important details. We promise to provide you with information in a timely manner and give you plenty of notice, once a date is set.
Happy #FurFestFriday! Gaming is a great way to find people who share your passions, or take a break and relax. However you make use of our gaming spaces, have fun!
Happy #FurFestFriday! There's no "right way" to enjoy a convention, just so long as you do. We try to make that easier with many flexible use areas throughout the event space.
Just for this I dove into my pic bin, these are some pics from
@Furfest
 2002. Yeah, these were pretty much the parade suits that year. Having a fursuit meant you knew someone or you made it yourself out of what you had.

Either way, we were all designers of our own suits, really.
Happy #FurFestFriday! We suspect games like this are much shorter when played with cats. #FursuitFriday
Our account is going black for the evening, in honor of
@dogbomb1
, an amazing person who has inspired so many in this fandom. We encourage all of you to make a donation, no matter how small, to http://alsa.org to help find a cure. ALS can kiss our fuzzy butts!
Happy #FurFestFriday! Lines are unavoidable, and we are working hard to minimize them this year. However, everything is better with friends! Do you have any favorite memories which were created while waiting in line?
Ok, ok furballs! Our joke hit too close to home for some, so to avoid further confusion (and frustration for our hotel staff), we pulled it down.  ...happy April Fools.
Please check back later this month for more information on this year's room lottery!

Happy #FurFestFriday! It has been said the point of modern art is to inspire an emotional response. What emotion does this bring out in you?
Happy #FurFestFriday! Nobody rocks like furries do. (Mostly because it's kind of crazy to dance your tail off while wearing a carpet... and tail) But we love it and we love you! #FursuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! Photos like these always amuse us social media staffers... Who has the flip-side of this? #FursuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! However you express the animal within, we love to see your creativity flourish at Midwest FurFest!
Happy #FurFestFriday! We know the time between now and MFF feel about as long as the Habitrails®, but we hope to start making announcements regarding this year's event in about a month.  (Late March, early April.) #FursuitFriday

Listen, MFF Social Media Team here AGAIN to talk about business casual. Just pretend you're boring people. Like, RP as a business traveler here for a business convention. Until Wednesday night. Please? We good?
*sighs*  Your MFF Social Media team now realizes that our tweet about pants being part of business casual was made with the mistaken assumption that attendees would also be wearing shirts with them. We regret the error.
Your MFF Social Media Team would like to apologize for any uncertainty with regards to our previous tweet, but would like to clarify that business casual does indeed still include pants.
To our early attendees; Please keep in mind that until 7PM Wednesday, we are sharing the Hyatt with business guests. The Hyatt has always been accommodating and respectful to us, so please help us return that respect and maintain a "business casual" atmosphere until then.

Please note: you'll need to be fully vaccinated by the first day of the con, which is 2 weeks after the last dose. We will post reminders to assist in planning.
Information on how we will be checking attendee vaccination will be released at a later date.

In addition, information regarding legally required exceptions to vaccination will be provided within the coming days.
Info regarding #BLFC2021 attendance

TL;DR

Vaccine is REQUIRED to attend
Masks are REQUIRED per state regulations

Changes to how con events and amenities operate may change to comply with any future safety regulations.

We hope to see you in Neo-Reno soon!
If you previously booked a room at the Nugget for 2020, there looks to still be room for you at the GSR! Please forward your Nugget confirmation to hotel@goblfc.org and we will get you set up.
Citizens of Neo-Reno, don't forget to sign up for our cyberpunk inspired Fashion Show!

RE: #BLFC2021 HOTEL ROOMS

If you had a con block room reservation for the original BLFC2020 dates but cancelled, an email has been sent with an offer to rebook your room.
While all our attendees are epic with a lower case “e”, not all can be Epic with a capital “E”.

Upgraded registration levels - Epic, Patron and Sponsor - are all sold out.
Please be advised we anticipate little, if any, room inventory will remain after recipients of the below-referenced email act upon the offer to rebook their original room.
RE: #BLFC2021 HOTEL ROOMS -

If you had a con-block room reservation for the original BLFC2020 dates but canceled it, you will receive an offer on Friday, July 30, to re-book your room for our Oct 2021 dates. Be sure to check your email!
If you are planning to attend #BLFC2021 and do not - and have not ever - had a con block hotel room booked (for either 2020 or 2021), your best bet now is to seek out friends with room space available. It is unlikely you will be able to book a room yourself.
Also get vaccinated
#̶B̶L̶F̶C̶2̶0̶2̶0̶ #BLFC2021 is only a few months away! Don’t forget your:
- Travel arrangements

- List of things you want to buy from vendors
- COVID-19 vaccination
Please look for an email dated 3/21/21, from noreply@goblfc.org. We generated these emails from a list the hotel sent us. Passkey will _not_ show the updated date.
If you can't find the 3/21 email, please call 1-800-648-5080 with your name and confirmation number to confirm.

 ...
E-mail confirmations for movement of con-block room reservations to our new dates have been going out.  Be sure to check the email you originally used when reserving your room, including any bulk mail folders.
Re: Room reservations:

Original Passkey reservation numbers will not show your updated reservation information, so using old emails to check on your reservation won’t work.

Do know that we are able to see most all reservations have been moved, and you’ll get confirmation soon.
We don't yet know what state/local requirements will be for large gatherings in October, nor what policies will be in place then.

For now, one should operate under the assumption masks will be required in public spaces, and vaccination will be required for travel and attendance.
Vaccine eligibility is expanding across the country. We highly encourage you to get vaccinated when able. Doing so may be required for travel, hotel check-in, attendance for a variety of events in the future. Getting your vaccine will ensure you're prepared and protected.
Please wait at least a couple weeks before attempting to book an off-block room for our new dates. In order to allow time to move all con-block reservations, any attempts to book off-block right now will just yield "sold out" results.
Announcing #BLFC2021’s new dates: October 21-24, 2021!
Important announcement re: #BLFC2021:
Please consider supporting Kelcema Audio via their GoFundMe.  They’ve been a fixture of cons for years now, and essential to cons’ dance and production experiences; the cancelation and suspension of conventions through this last year has hit them hard.

Just in case anyone had missed it - BLFC will not be taking place this weekend!

Have a safe and happy Halloween, vote early, and we hope to see you in June 2021!

By now, many of those holding an in-block reservation for BLFC2020 should have received an email from the GSR about your reservation being moved to BLFC2021.  If you haven't yet seen this email, keep an eye out for it arriving shortly (and an eye on your spam/bulk mail folder).

BLFC2020 was originally scheduled to begin this week, but has been rescheduled for the end of October.

To make getting through this convention-less weekend easier, though, why not let the miracle of Photoshop put you in Reno and at the GSR?!
Reno area furries are covering up and staying safe - and stylish!

Left over swag bandanas from prior convention years were delivered to local furs to use as masks and face coverings and help flatten that curve.

Stay home, furries! And if you have to go out, cover up!
While #BLFC2020 has been postponed until October, the Save Haven Wildlife Sanctuary - a BLFC charity for several years - is caring for animals year-round.  If you have the money to spare, we’d love it if you considered donating!

*HUUUUUUUUUUGS*

We  you and everyone else at the GSR!
You currently may not change your reservation to our new dates, or book new ones on our new dates, *precisely because they are holding all rooms and inventory for the migration, as well as dealing with current casino closures*.  Be patient and understanding.  Thank you!
If you have an off-block reservation, please also wait a few weeks at least before trying to call the GSR to move your reservation. Rooms will be available in October, but they are far too busy to make reservation changes right now. Attempt to make changes online if able.
BLFC2020 attendees: Please understand our room block migration will take some time. We ask that you not call the GSR to attempt to move your reservation yourself, as hotel reservations and support staff will be very busy. Let us and the GSR handle your room migration as planned.
With regards to con block reservations: as some inventory may become available over the next few weeks, we will announce details on booking later.

If you wish to transfer a room reservation name (i.e., keep room, but put it in friend's name) please wait til after date migration.
Answering recurring questions -

-  Early Bird registration pricing for #BLFC2020 will be extended. Stay tuned for details.
- Patron/Epic levels are limited supply (due to limited supply of swag); is contingent upon how many of said reg level types free up over the next weeks.

Friendly reminder - our line management system works best if you catch elevators from the spa level in order to go up to rooms on higher floors.  Elevators prioritize the spa level, and service elevator escorts work from spa level.

Thank you all for your understanding!

During peak elevator use periods we also have volunteers escorting groups of people to the service elevators, from spa level and going up.
Please no congregating or smoking in the stairwells.
GSR security is being exceptionally nice and letting us use the central stairwell. Please do not ruin their generosity :3
Also feel free to use a different elevator and then take stairs for a few flights.
Please do not try to use the stairwells at the end of hotel wings; they are still exit-only.
Due to elevator overloading, the central staircase will be staying open. Please feel free to use the stairwells for any short trip between a few floors.

#BLFC2019
Your snazzy red Sponsor/Patron/Epic  (and blue staff) swag elixir bottles have a protective plastic strip on the inside of the lid. Be sure to remove it before loading up on free Coke Freestyle drinks at Port of Subs!  Also remove the paper info card inside.They don’t taste good.
Advice to all
@BiggestLittleFC
 Sponsors & above who get the stainless steel water bottle:

1. Before you wash it, remove the small piece of paper inside
2. Remove the small piece of plastic inside the lid
3. It fills up FAST at Port of Subs and you can’t see how full it is. #BLFC
Registration is now open!

All Adventurers can now pick up their badges in the Nevada Room.

Our podcast continues!
Ah, the big city! What shenanigans can our country bumpkin Adventurers get up to in the next episode of the podcast.

There are those who you don't want to ever meet in a dark alley.

Or a brightly lit alley.

Or any sort of confined area between buildings really.

Find out what happens to those people in the next episode of our podcast.

(Hint: the rogue did it.)
If/when you email them, it helps to include...

- what it’s made of/what materials it uses
- its size, scale
- pictures of it, if possible

Thinking of buyin' a room reservation off a scalper?

*smacks your hand away*

Don't! Doing so could result in losing your room, and your money! With a scalped room, all that's guaranteed is you'll pay way too much money, for way too much risk and uncertainty.
If you have not received the notification email for the Group 1 room drawing, you can go to https://hotel.goblfc.org to see whether or not your entry was picked - click the Sign in With BLFC link to sign in to the account with which you entered the drawing.
Group 2 entries begin December 17th!

Thank you all for entering, and for joining us on our 2019 campaign!
Winners will have to Dec. 16th to use their Passkey link to book a room; a refundable (if canceled) deposit of first night’s rate plus taxes and fees will be charged at booking; unused entry selections will be returned to the pool of available rooms.
Email notifications for Group 1 room drawing results are being sent out. Please check your inbox (including spam/bulk folders, just in case).  You may also login at https://hotel.goblfc.org to see if your entry was selected and to verify.
Remember, you are under no obligation to use the booking link. You may hand it off to someone else, but they will see all of your personal info, so please be cautious. All unused rooms roll over to the next wave.

Any additional info can be found at http://goblfc.org/hotel
If you did get a winning email and the site isn’t showing a booking link, please email regdev@goblfc.org so they may fix the issue.

The booking links will be good all week, until the next drawing starts, so you don’t need to reserve right away!
To clear up some confusion:

Everyone who entered the room drawing will get an email declaring if you were selected or not. Emails are still going out, so please hold tight while everybody gets notified.

For those that got in, the site has been updated to reflect that.
For those who were selected for a room, the site is experiencing an issue. Please bear with us while a fix is coming. Our apologies for the delay.

#BLFC18
Someone just have an answer...
My #BiggestLittleFurCon #photos are now online at my SmugMug.

@BiggestLittleFC
Should note that on the website are the credits for the vocals and participants on the CD that was sold and not the live show which had some cast that was different.
So... How many of you liked the musical!?

If you haven't already, why not take a moment to acknowledge all the people who made it possible!

The credits has people I didn't even think would contribute. So many people...

#BLFC18
I predict that
@BiggestLittleFC
 had attendance of at least one (I was there) and less than 8 billion people.

Leaning toward much much less than 8 billion, but can't be for certain!

@BiggestLittleFC

WE'RE NOT ALL GONE YET!!!
Hey, even more fursuiters!

How are you still here?!

I love it!
18) In the future:  Slow down!  Think about the sources of your information.  Don’t spread rumors.  Don’t attack people on twitter.  Give the benefit of the doubt when you hear a situation has been handled:  You will never have all the information if your only source is hashtags.
Hey! Found fursuiters still going strong today. This is a good thing.
Please be advised: An accident has shut down the ramps from 395N to I-80 (east and west).  If you need to get on to I-80 you may want to consider alternate routes - and drive safely!
Remember to give yourself some extra time if/when heading to the airport!  While it’s just a short ride and
@grandsierra
 has free shuttles running back and forth, a large crowd of fellow departing con goers could mean a bit of a wait for shuttle space.
@BiggestLittleFC

There's a plane, bound to fly you off to somewhere, back to the inside of my phone...

Safe travels to everyone who came to #BLFC18. We'll be seeing ya!
*fade out*
No, I won't say goodbye.
And I don't want to hear you say it either.
Only time can keep us apart now.
So, I won't say goodbye.
But, I can tell you, it was a Good Con.

#BLFC18
Sad that #BLFC18 has ended?

Don’t be, because it hasn’t!  There’s more music and dancing to be had in the Main Stage!

Because this adds complexity I can't ALWAYS promise the comic will update at midnight precisely. Some days, pages will just have to be done when they're done. Sometimes I'll swap or bump pages from other comics depending on what's in the pipeline.
Housepets has priority, meaning it should be updating AT LEAST once/week, sometimes more. We also have a new production pipeline, as
@KyleSmeallie

@KaeEsrial
