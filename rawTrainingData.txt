Why? Because you will have to live your life a someone else sees fit.

The way this conversation has gone so far is that you said people should have unobstructed access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I said poor kids don't get this because of, among other things, lack of safe housing.
When the words promising us Life Liberty and the pursuit of happiness were written, they were not written only for those who were alive in that day, but they were written for future generations, all of whom were unborn.
The Constitution does not give the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to a fetus but it does to living human beings outside the womb.  Guns kill people including children.  Four lives were just lost and yet you haven't said squat.

Not eat the ones that talk - they have aspirations. Because Good values sentient life. That is the whole of it. You can still be chaotic—but the chaos would be more likely to be channeled into art, or some other creative pursuit. Your boyfriend will appreciate such hard work!
Abortion isn't that black and white. The issue really is how much should society infringe a woman's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to protect those rights of the unborn child.
Some complaints from a few people on how small trials tend to be in rare diseases, suggesting they wish they were bigger, so they could have gotten spots in high demand trials (surprised me).

Leaves me wondering if that’s a pursuit for early access to medication (I think so).

Guns are NOT a problem so this pursuit makes you look ridiculous.  I don’t have guns and they don’t get a second of consideration in my long list of worries so seeing you present guns as a problem is a stain on your reputation. We have bigger problems, waaaay bigger.

my cousin is engaged to a furry and I refuse to him her fiancé. I prefer to call him her furbaby.
Seems like a good plan. Really shows people that being a furry isn’t a personality it’s a hobby. A second channel dedicated to furry stuff would be the best option. Am proud of you

Actual furry! Not a drill!

Listen. That pic I posted earlier was the first furry art I've every drawn and I drew and erased that snout about 100 times. If I can make something that looks half decent, I know you can make something 1000 times better.

You need to shame him for being a furry. Early and often, maybe you can save him from a horrible fate.

And about what all of you saw that I've accidentally exposed his top secret location & his street address shown right here on Twitter. Don't worry, every furry YouTuber keeps their address a secret. Hope all of you are going to have a good time celebrating my birthday.
Happy December everyone! 2021 is almost over, the year we've done had been ups & downs. I've witnessed #FoldsOfHonorQuikTrip500 returns with the fans in the stands. To the day my number 1 furry crush Tilt Longtail broke up with me that changed the course of history forever.

I mean I've seen some furry artists and would love to get a commission. But Bulgarian AK's that are milled are not cheap.
Being a furry is so based and awesome tho
Just say "furry convention". They've heard it before. At least at the Canada/US border I've had someone be _curious_ about it, but you're likelier to encounter hostility by seeming evasive than you are by just answering the question.

In cultural context, same-sex marriage would have been unacceptable because it would violate patriarchal gender norms. Jesus points us beyond these divisions and toward gender equality. Since that patriarchal logic shouldn’t apply to Christians, we can affirm LGBTQ relationships.

To win or lose, succeed or fail, is sometimes not as important as trying and giving our best despite all the challenges that befall us. Life does not allow us to consistently control outcomes but we can control our efforts. That means something.

Growth comes in many forms. Some may need to retract. Some may need more support or more space. Regardless of what this year has been for you, find the strength to move forward. Grow. Be that better person you idolize and wanna be.

Wanna know why you should appreciate nice and good people. Because it takes far more effort to be nice than nasty. So when someone is being nice to you, just remember they are making an effort to be nice to you. Nasty toxic people don't make an effort.
If you put your mind  to it, you can accomplish anything !
In this hard times optimist and empathy  gonna lead us to a better tomorrow!

True love doesnt mean you have a perfect, effortless relationship

True love means that despite no matter how hard things get, no matter how much you fight, no matter how many problems you have, you work through it at and at the end of the day you still love your partner the same
this is adorable
@Kurtt_Wuff
 I wonder where Kurtt got the idea for his fursona's colors? Those are the most beautiful colors I've ever witnessed.
Everything is clear in the rear view mirror,only love make everything fits, singing your song make me feel alive because you are part of me, we own the night full of stars , at your side the road is the great adventure i will dare to furrow

In life there are times that you have to make decisions and take paths, be the right ones or not, you have to dare to take the step, it might be a long trip and full of obstacles. Keep going,  exploring, living experiences, growing with the right company & nothing will stop you!!

Never forget that your emotions are what make you strong. Take aim of them, focus and learn to harness your emotions. Don’t let them control you and don’t let them decide your actions but use them to better guide your decisions.

Currently mailing a letter only costs .55 cents. Do you want to be paying $5 for that? Do you want to have unregulated rates for shipping? Do you want to pay a fortune to ship internationally? $200 shipping for a $5 item on wish sound sexy to you?
I don’t know who needs to hear this but rest is not a reward. You don’t have to earn rest. You need rest. You deserve rest. You are worthy of rest simply because you are a living being. And don’t ever feel guilty for taking time to rest.

Thank you.

Heading onward to new horizons.
So, it's the new year. 2019 was really interesting, to say the least. some of the highest highs I've ever had, and my lowest lows. It was one hell of a roller coaster for me, but ultimately it led to me bettering myself and learning how to cope with certain things, y'know?

>
why has nobody made a VR game where you dual with lightsabers. that would be so cool.

I WOULD BUY THAT.
Fiiiiinally back home after a really fun weekend in the city!
It's a new year!!!

I have a lot of plans, aspirations and things I want to do this year, and i'm excited to get to actually doing them! Buuuuut i'm super tired so i'm going to have some TEA FIRST then sleep!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

i just spent SO LONG working on my new gal's little redesign/touch up, i'm so happy with it! i spent like 6 hours on it LMAO
I found ghost pepper chips in the grocery store today.

I'm currently eating ghost pepper chips.

they taste like pain. like hurt. like they found the recipe for "AH FUCK" and put it on these chips. but i keep eating them. i can't STOP. I LOVE THE SPICE.
For reference this is about my character Lotus who I want made into a suit. She’s primarily black, but I’m currently adjusting her design to be more fursuit friendly and wondering if a dark grey is better than black for her primary colour!

Any advice helps, thank you!
Question for suit makers and artists:

In reference to a fursuit - when you’re dealing with a darker coloured character, should black fur be avoided? Should I make my black a dark grey instead? Or is black okay?

Just figuring some stuff out for my new gal who I want as a suit!
It’s exactly TWO WEEKS away until my birthday!!
There’s a tiger in the grass!  Happy #FursuitFriday

VRChat&Fursuit parts Update ~Currently working hard on completing my queue before opening more commissions. Sorry for the inconvenience. I will make tweet post & telegram channel(Pin tweet)For Updates! Got a few more fursuit projects to finish up & recolors! Hope to open soon! :)
Anyone find it strange in real life when I'm out visiting friends when I could back in the days before covid. I don't really make direct eye contact and still have a conversation. Now in VR I still do the same . Not having eye contact but in reality cant see where my eyes at xD
Who wants some paws???  #dailyDHC get them in the link below!

Can't seem to have proper sleep the past few days. Keep waking up  My mind won't stop thinking. Nothing bad. Seems my mind feels it's awake like a normal day schedule. I feel tried but can fall back asleep and also having mild sleep apnea doesn't help either. Aaaaaaaaaaa lol

Good news! My mother is no long showing any more symptoms. We have a specialist  going with us step by step on what to do. My mother no longer in quarantine & feeling back to normal as so as my other parts of the family as well recovered. I am so relieved & not stressing any more
Another confirm case  but this time from my mother who I live with. We are taking precaution and keeping distance. I'm going out getting tested to be safe by next week when they open for the drive-thru test. This is really stressing me out. Please stay safe out there.
It’s definitely not as warm as it was in Pawaii here at #AnthroNorthwest2019 but Ruff is still in the island mood.

Sadly to say that I am canceling FE2020 and donating my reg.  I was looking forward to this con and been trying to go for many years. Lot of friends and family are worried for my heath and recommend me to stay. I can always try for next years.
Unsure to attend FE and donate my registration and go next year's. I'm keeping an eye out if things get worse. I'll decide on Sunday or Monday if I'm going or not.
Reminder, we are still taking applications for the fursuot charity dance auction.

Slots this year are limited and we are closing submissions on April 20th.

To those who have already replied, you may expect an answer soon.

Apply here:
Feeling better today finally. So much sleeping & medication. I have lot of work to catch up too!  Now I can continue what I love to do. Make paws and other fursuit parts. Thinking after BLFC. Want to work on bigger projects & make full suits & limit paws. So I can work on both :)
I'm thinking I'm getting more sick. Taking medication and vitamins to feel better before it gets worse. It's slowly creeping on me. I don't want con crud again Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I want to make awesome paws.
It was great meeting

This con hahaha...legit! ANW is good ish XD
From the call today and the damage is not fixable it seems. I had that Pathfinder for a good 7 years and also just payed it off a few months back with new tires, brakes and rotor, battery, oil change, renew license plates, new timing center. Feels all that went to waste
Welp my car is a totaled loss. Got the call from the car repaired, Rip.  Now got to wait for updates later from the insurance.
Made it back home Zzz. Time to sleep and wait for next week for MFF! :)
Good bye #ANW2019 It's been so fun! Hope to be there next year!
Ahhh! I love these behind-the-scenes photos where I'm doing the thing. :D Trying out a new technique, I'm excited!

If I had a second fursona. What would I be?
I have a pare of orange fur with pink pads I made accidentally. Any one would be interested of getting all orange indoor paws or with a different color with orange bottom fur indoor paws? :) DM me for more information or questions.
What do you guys recommend? For my work live streams. picartoTv or twitchTv?
I can't decide lol. I also wanting to play my music at the same time. I know twitch is very distracted about copyright music. I'm not sure about picarto.
Pink pads wip

Thinking of doing some live streams wile I work on fursuit making in the week and maybe some gaming on the weekends? What do you guys think? :) or just gaming on the weekends? :3
Thinking of doing MFF paw deliveries again for this year. How I got my room set :) would anyone be interested to commission paws and have them delivered at the con? Only vote if your interested for paws.

 hanging out with our adorable cria
It's almost spoopy month, decided to start early with a pic of Chip and Ash :3
I love how every time I look at twitter I am reminded of why I try not to look at twitter.
:D it me
I've been adding so much more details to Izzy's mane compared to when I drew her for the very first time!

Also my facial expressions have gotten better! o3o
WHY?!
We may or may not be at mff this year do to some other obligations that just came up. I will keep everyone posted but I do still want to get moving on this project
I am thinking about trying to film season 2 of the fandom at some point in this coming year. Would anyone be interested in chatting at MFF or TFF this year?
I just  want you all to know that I am finding my way again, that I am sorry its taken so long and that I love you all so much. Thank YOU for making this journey a magical one.
Since releasing it I fell into a depression. One that I have only been able to peak out of a few times since. The more visible I got the harder it was for me to be me. In so many ways I have just withdrawn from everything.
Hey so I just wanted to say something because I feel like it needs to be said. When we released the fandom it was a project that was a labor of love for our small team. Going through that experience took an incredible toll on myself in almost every facet of my life.
Heyo just a reminder to everyone I am still taking a break from social media and really only check this account in the morning. I just dont have the energy to deal with stuff these days

Finally! #Twilight is done!

I’m pretty happy with it! I put so much effort in this #edit and I really hope you like it
Now the mane 6 are all done!

#mlp #mlpg5 #MyLittlePonyANewGeneration #fanart
So I will be attending MFF assuming work doesn't eat up all my free time but it will probably be a pretty low key con for me because I haven't had a relax con since like a year before the pandemic.
I wish we could attend BLFC but life is too busy atm. Looking forward to seeing all you amazing folks soon.

If you thought the wild west was only a place straight white cis-men could go to shoot their little guns and spit wherever they wanted, think again.
@TenaciousRanch
 is yelling “GIT” to that narrative by offering a rural safe haven for queer and trans people to work and live.
I will be getting surgery on the 23rd and will be a little out of it for a week or so. Just transition stuff nothing to worry about.
I’m watching the fandom: a furry documentary while doodling and the sense of community just;; makes me teary

Not sad by any means but just. Hearing people talk about finding their sense of belonging in the early days really speaks to me

Indigenous Māori people from New Zealand likely discovered Antarctica 1,000+ years before Europeans reached it in the 18th century, says a new study.

Researchers, making use of oral history, say Māori and Polynesian explorers likely reached it as early as the 7th century.

 The Day You Became a Furry

Today I am joined by my friend Porter, and we are checking out possibly the darkest and most surreal furry animation I have ever seen!!
 https://bit.ly/3aLa8qE
Made some fanart of
@AshCoyote
 today!! Her happy and positive videos have been helping me stay sane and calm in this crappy pandemic, so I just wanted to say thank you~

Hello all! Ash's Social Media Manager here! I thought I'd share some fun facts about me to help introduce myself
- I've been in the furry fandom for over 10 years!
- I'm a trans, non-binary person (He/They pronouns)
- My favourite animals are African Wild Dogs
Starting now my account is being handled by my social media manager. Lots of love everyone! See you on youtube ^_^
I might be trans.
I have received a few messages about unfollowing folks accounts, this is apart of preparing this account for business and handing it off to my social media manager.

#furry #furryart #furrydrawing
I watched that documentary “Hero” that
@AshCoyote
 made!

First of all, it’s a wonderful watch, would recommend!

Second of all,
@WaggeryCos
 is super impressive to me! If you’re in the market for a suit don’t sleep on them!!
As of Monday I will no longer be actively using this account for social. It will be managed by a third party for business related to my channel. I came to this decision due to a lot of struggles that I have had with my mental health over the past year.
How to photograph yourself for YouTube lol
DAT FACE THO
Just watched "Hero" by
@AshCoyote
 Really touching. Great job to the
@WaggeryCos
 team and film production team. As a fursuit maker and someone who's watched my mom battle illness as well its really inspired me. I hope you have a speedy recovery

 WOW!!! Congratulations

Freedom of Speech ≠ Freedom from Consequences
Furry sponsored classroom field trips to benefit wildlife education /conservation should totally be a thing
Artists should be paid for their work. “Exposure” is not payment and doesn’t put food on an artist’s table nor will it pay their rent or bills.

RI furs admin here. We’re postponing all meets as well. I’m so sorry that happened to you, and surely says something about the current admins. If you need anything or even just to vent don’t hesitate to reach out.
Maine Furs admin here. We put a stop to all of our meets (furbowl, swimming, etc.) due to the pandemic. It's actual lives and health of those around us at stake, not just a popularity contest. I'm sorry you were kicked for doing the right thing. Keep protecting those you care for
Practically all of MA in in shut down. They are fools to think this is no big deal and they should stop any meets. And people should be more sensible and not attend even if they were being held.
Hey!

I am the owner of my own community groups! The admin team and myself have postponed all our monthly meetups until further notice! Though this community is heckin' great! We plan to all meet up in VRChat and run community contests until this pandemic is taken care of!
Folks, with Covid-19 happening and the CDC recommendation of no groups larger than 50, attending Furmeets and Furbowls should be put off till this global crisis is over. It’s an unpopular idea for many but it’s about being a responsible adult and keeping others safe.
Convention Organizers - if you are delaying or canceling your convention, drop us a DM and we’ll happily get the information out to our followers.
Furries. Cons are doing everything they can with this situation. Please be nice to their staff. They're people too and are stressed, just like the rest of us.
“The most important lesson I learned from Furry Fiesta is that just because a group of people are marginalized because of their kink, that doesn’t mean they don’t have a culture and vibrancy of their own.”
ATTENTION:

It is with great sadness that we must cancel our 2020 convention until further notice on the advice of both health officials and business partners. Our attendees’ next steps are our priority and we want to make sure you’re informed. Read more: https://furnalequinox.com/2020/03/13/furnal-equinox-2020-cancellation/…

#PrEP #truvada
And finally to prevent drama such as this, consider Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) such as Truvada.  You take one pill, once a day.  It’s 92% - 99% effective in prevention of HIV transmission.  Most can get the drug for low to no cost.
Disclosing someone’s HIV status online is considered the same as DOXing them, may violate state laws and violates HIPPA, and opens you up to both criminal and civil charges
If you are sexually active, you should test for HIV every 6 months at minimum, and for other STIs even more frequently if you do not use protection.
If someone is HIV positive and is on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), and their viral load becomes undetectable, they can not transmit the disease to someone else.
If you are unsure of your partner’s status, ask.  In many states, you must disclose your HIV status if asked.  You are responsible for your own health.  Take that responsibility seriously
Seems there is an uproar about HIV infection going on. First, as a former CDC employee, I can say, unless there is large scale outbreak, HIV is dealt with by local Infectious Disease Specialists, and local Health Departments, not a team from the CDC

  Thank you for taking the time to treat Furries with a shred of dignity in your latest (and hopefully not final) episode.  Drew lots of parallels between it and CSI Fur and Loathing but in a good way!

There is a furry convention at the casino where we had Mother’s Day brunch. My daughter said “I would rather hang with these people 100x over than a room full of conservative Christians”. Smart kid I’ve raised.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

Thanks to each and every one of you who have shown your support to Emma and her family.

We had over 40 suiters come out for her photo shoot. Many of whom stayed afterwards to interact and play with Emma and the other kids.

Relationships are hard. Work on your relationships every day. It takes communications, understanding, and lots of love. The pain can be immeasurable, as can the pleasure. And then there is the warm feeling of love you carry with you. Always worth it in the end

He was a good fur.  His name was Kimbalion. He was cute as heck. Smart. Energetic. Adventurous. He loved rollerblading. I knew him since the 90s but we’d lost touch over the last few years. And now he’s gone. A friend stopped running today.

I encourage any artist to block people who openly believe art doesn't need credit. Keep your work safe from those who are fine with stealing your hard work and distributing it, damaging your online footprint.

From Bleeding Cool -
Also, most states have statutes in place requiring license to practice law - doing so without is a crime and can land you in prison.
Good advice to any Furry Convention - have a licensed lawyer on your board, or at least a good lawyer on retainer.  It can save your con.

Interesting concept...
If buying a fursuit or art where you are spending hundreds to thousands of $$, consider using an Escrow service like http://Escrow.com
Would you be angry if a Fursuit maker claims they can't refund your money, but they can seem to afford going to conventions every 2 months?
The example contract is just that - an example.  Please check online for a contract for your state or country!
Law Depot has a great "Independent Contractor Agreement" - Example is here -https://dropbox.com/s/lwcvei36owe2mfp/Independent%20Contractor%20Agreement.pdf?dl=0… Protect yourself when buying or selling!
Should fursuit makers or artists and purchasers sign a binding purchase and sale agreement – so both parties are legally protected?
Have you ever been stiffed by an artist or fursuit maker?  Chime in and let us know!

You guys are awesome, thanks for making my work with fursuits possible, thanks for allowing me to have this job, I'm glad and lucky to meet such nice and great people!
It's getting hard and expensive to get Fur due to shipping costs +  brazilian import taxes that are 60%  of the total amount for federal taxes + 25% for state taxes and they want to raise the taxes further!
I got my BEANS from

I'm giving everything that I have right now to make the best I can including improving some little quirks on my fursuit head shapes, making a much better lining inside the head, improving ventilation, weight, ease to wear, to clean and overall durability.
Sometimes if feels like punching water and not getting anywhere, but today I'm super happy with the results and I'm much more confident to move forward with the next commissions.
Also thanks a lot for the patience of those that are still waiting on their suits from me.
The work time and patience invested to fix some little bugs on my moving jaws is finally paying off getting some nice results. It has been a challenge to make a mechanism that doesn't require screws, elastic or springs, it has been over 2 years since I draw the first ideas.

  are going to find it.
I think we finally covered and organized the house and workshop enough to be able to go back on building suits again.
So, I've decided that before I put this fursuit for auction I want to give a chance for people to get it for a solid price of $ 3000 USD + Shipping.

Head size: 22,2' -  23,2' ( 56,5 - 59 cm )
Model size : 5,8 ( 178cm ) wheight  158 lbs ( 72kg )
Maker : Furry Machine
We may put this kitty for auction later.
It's a full suit that I've done for a client here in Brazil as a commission but he couldn't afford to finish paying.
We made a deal that we can sell the suit with full rights for the fursona as well.
Just now I found out that I took this pics on the same position in two different situations with two different hobbies. Lol
So, I will enjoy it to do an fursuit vs fursuiter

He’s a fraud but I still like him. #aggretsuko #torajima
It's still a work in progress, will look much better and organized after we get everything placed.
Since we got a lot of stuff done today we could update a bit more the workshop.
Little by little we are getting all the things placed and working, we are almost done with everything.
Today I went out with my mother in law to help her to get stuff done and tomorrow I need update the bills on my name this on the new house.
Assembling new workshop at the new house.
The cats accepted the new house very well, and we finally brought all of our stuff, time to unpack everything and put some appliances working.
Bringing the left over stuff to the new house, two more trips to go yet.
Thanks everyone for the 7K followers.
Now let's look for the 8k, 9k and 10k.
Lots of traffic today.
We still have stuff left behind to bring to the new house.
Packing stuff non stop since yesterday 11 AM and it's 1:45  AM but, there's not so much to store anymore.
Very soon we will be living and working over here.

What do you get when you cross a kigurumi and a fursuit? A fleecesuit! We've created a new style that is comfy, easy to wear, affordable, and still has elements of a fullsuit (Foot/hand paws, full-sized tail). Hood with ears optional! #fursuit #furry #cosplay #fleece #twokinds

Truck drivers got what they were asking and they are going back to work little by little.

Things are slowly settleling down in Brazil.
The situation in Brazil right now is so Rough, that we can not even send people to hell because there is no gasoline to get over there.
We're currently facing a terrible crisis here in Brazil. I hope they come to an agreement fast, since many people have been and are being affected. As for myself, biggest concern is not having fuel, even if I... try to go somewhere else. Geez.
yeah... they still didin't solve the issue yet, there are a lot of truck drivers that are still on strike.  I comemorated too early. ^^'''
Good news. after 4 days of Stryke, the goverment offered one deal in exchange of 15 days of truce.
( d'ammm things worked out fast this time )
Imagine you paying $8.89 on each liter of gasoline. ( if you find) ^^'
I already got my tank full to the top in case I need.
All truck drivers in Brazil are on strike since this last monday, gas stations are running out of fuel, food stocks are low, supermarkets are running out of products, there is 40% less bus on the streets even some airports are without fuel.
I am not worthy...

The PlayStation 3 and PS Vita stores will close down in a few months. You better get the games that are going to be super hard to find because retro games will become more expensive.

I highly recommend that you get Klonoa.

We of the furry fandom will not tolerate racism in our world. There is no need for Asian hate and there are lots of Asian people in the US that have been murdered lately.

This site is very important. Please donate and spread the word. #StopAsianHate

LRT: This. If you're a minor, please be careful on how you approach certain people. Feel free to call out people if they're doing awful things like grooming.

Grown adults grooming minors is NOT okay. Pedophiles are terrible people.
Minors in this community, please remember it's not normal for grown adults to be attracted to you. They might sweet talk you and make you believe it's OK, that you're the one exception, mature for your age etc.
These are grooming techniques. They know what they're doing.

If I wanted to experience an actual con I would have to spend hundreds on passport renewal and airfare to get out of the country.
Americans have like 50 cons to choose from and here in the UK you only get 1 proper con. And that con (confuzzled) always plants itself at the end of may right in the middle of academic exam season giving a huge middle finger to anyone still studying.

Verdict not surprising. Sets a silly precedent.
Maybe its just Twitter being extremely toxic as per
Also people put way too much social value on a glorified carpet.
Being a furry is just joining after hearing about how welcoming the community is and then eventually realising over time that the community is becoming increasingly unwelcoming and open armed because of trivial things like your personal investment choices :/

The Police are pigs and the only good police officers are the ones that quit or get fired because they are good.
No no no. Media please don't do this.

*Police* killed 8-year-old Fanta Bility.

*Police* say teenagers were involved in a separate conflict blocks away and claim that's why they fired their guns.

The teenagers had no role in her death.

For once, don't buy the police narrative.

So yeah if you’re in the right sector (STEM usually) then in America it’s pretty rosey so long as you don’t have to frequent the hospital.
Oh yeah and the Tax burden is always way less in America too. Healthcare costs is the only real caveat.
Even when you have no right to time off etc with them kind of salaries if you’re in the right industry you americans never realise how much worse it is in other places. In countries like Russia I’d imagine its even worse than it is here in the UK
I got offered 17k GBP for my would be first job with a global top accounting firm in a pretty high COL area. And I have to read Americans in the field moan that their starting job “only” pays them 50k USD :V

100% serious when I say the Onion’s 9/11 coverage deserved a Pulitzer
You ever see someone you thought you were pretty chill with just unfollow you out of nowhere and spend the next hour wondering why?
Reading through and seeing how muslims and other groups of people were treated during and following 9/11 and how people blamed them for what happened is just really upsetting. Imagine being ostracised by your own teachers in front of everyone at school or something. Awful.
Paw fetish national anthem
On 9/11/73 the US supported a fascist coup in Chile against the democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende.

In most of the world, this event is known as "the 1st 9/11", but is largely unknown in the US.

Here are Allende's final words, broadcast to the nation.
I personally don't think 9/11 should continue to be a "holiday" as it currently is, because it's pretty much used as a lever of nationalism, xenophobia, islamophobia, and general hate, rather than leaving room for healing and grief.

All working hard in school with the panic and making myself sick with stress is seemingly going to get me is an underpaid, overworked and soulless office job where I’m racing to pay my extortionate rent costs at the end of the month to some cunt that was born at a better time.
My dad always told me to work hard in school and I’ll never regret it. Everyone older than me in my family said it to me actually. They told me if I work hard now I will have it all. A house, family, nice car, nice bit of cash in the bank for holidays. It was all a fucking lie.
Glad to know we’ll have to carry the burden of retiring baby boomers on our backs for most of our lives after they fucked everything up for us and made it virtually impossible to have a stable lifestyle like they had on a plate for them without some large form of gifted capital.
So young people now have to pay more from the scraps they’re given to support systems that are clogged up mostly by pensioners and baby boomers with vacation homes and 6 or 7 fig retirement funds.

Great. Really incentives us to work hard.

@FeatheryFlukes
SO. MANY. PEOPLE.

Sorry to do this again but I'm sick of seeing this guy.

This guy goes to furry cons and r***s animals. At our conventions.

He had an after dark account for his own dog that furries would flirt with.

Click on his following and look at the wall off zoophile accounts.

These are the sorts of people we should be focusing on during Pride.

A Story In 4 Parts
Photografurs
See I’m not the only one that doesn’t close tabs
Too good not to share
Fur Fandom getting excited about a fursuit "auction" going for 50 grand, which is good.

But lets remember the photographers in the fandom.

Some have paid $10,000, $20,000, $40,000 for all there camera gear and we got people saying charging for fursuit photo shoots is a wrong.
how it started // how it’s going
Aight so on this game of civilsation 6 I created a religion called furryism and now the game has decided my apostle will spread 621 points of my religion per turn xDDD
Couldn’t say why but it’s abundantly obvious to me that this pic is from the UK
It’s ironic that basically all of furry from what I can see was hellbent on seeing the demise of crypto and now someone just nuked the world record fee for a fursuit on the back of cryptocurrency gains.
I was so close to making everything better but all I could do was watch as it slipped through my fucking fingers
I just wanna be a pooltoy floating in the pool on a hot summery day. No sad. Just vibes.

I don’t really want to die. I want to fall asleep indefinitely. I’ll wake up when things prove to get better. Tired of just chugging on under the failing assumption that things will inevitably get better. Things go the other way. They don’t get better.

I fucking hate technology. Would be nice not to have to fight tooth and fucking nail to achieve some basic functionality out of things I buy.
It hasn’t felt great seeing friends and people I look up to write me off as someone that’s not morally sound or whatever words they have for people they deem to be bad. Stop pretending to be on a higher level.
Reminder that there’s nothing wrong with cryptocurrency as a whole and that you shouldn’t look down on those with stakes in the market. Not every cryptocurrency has harmful components.

Remembering the time I was new to furry and I thought crinklewag just meant a cute way of expressing excitement so I started unironically using it without knowing it had something to do with diapers.
And yes Bitcoin, ETH etc. is flawed and deserves to perish.
Also tired of the “bitcoin represents the entire crypto market” line of thinking. It’s not true at all.
Tired of people on here not understanding that there are cryptocurrencies that aren’t reliant on environmentally damaging or immoral processes.

Plushies are great and all but cuddling with real people can be so much better
Pros: Super soft. You can cuddle my tail and sleep on it or use it as a blanket. Can be squeaky if you’d like! Just be sure to watch your claws

Cons: Will eat all of your food and getting up from cuddle naps with me would be super hard. Too comfy.

Protogens...where are your factory reset buttons?
It’s sad/irritating how often popufurs fly over the handle about things and make it all about themselves and then proceed to bully smaller accounts into backing down on their opinions, deleting tweets and going private. They always make up shit they can get mad over.
Is it wrong to wish that I wasn’t asexual sometimes?
I really just want to sleep and not wake up until shit like anxiety stops making my life harder than it should be. If it doesn’t go then I simply don’t want to wake up. I don’t want to die but I’d rather just sleep indefinitely.
I need to find a new release for temporarily escaping my anxiety and self loathing. Sleep doesn’t work anymore because it steals that away from me. Stuffing my face with junk food just leaves me obese and broke which makes me more sad.

Unsettling images
It’s not all big accounts but it’s like 75% of them I’d say.
I know people only have so much capacity in terms of communication over social media but when you spend 2 minutes posting a nice message only for it to go ignored and then see them reply to any account with enough followers and a fursuit you just have to roll your eyes.
Honestly sometimes I wonder why I’m still on here. Furry Twitter kinda fucking sucks.
They’ll interact with you if you hold an opinion that doesn’t align with their own. They just won’t interact in a good way lmao. But if you try to pass a positive message or something you’ll just get ignored along with the 100 other comments from sub 1k accounts.

call me crazy but it's extremely weird that we spent an entire pandemic yelling at antivaxxers to listen to scientists and the CDC when they said to quarantine and wear masks and get vaccinated but immediately got mad when the CDC announced that the vaccines are working

My FNAF songs folder. 25 projects in the works and counting
Time to hit my lawyer up.
Here’s some behind the scenes of an upcoming music video and a little taste of the song  #notlookingtofalldown
Nothing like waking up to the soundtrack of The Nightmare Before Christmas  Happy Halloween K9’s

Hope to see you all in today’s Spooktacular Stream starting at 3PM PDT!

This month I’ve been hit with nonstop claims daily from them; claiming my own music videos for me, and I have to tell them each time again and again that I’m handling my own monetization on those videos and that I am the official artist. I hope
@DistroKid
 never pulls this
I’m curious if they have suddenly started claiming the literal thousands of reuploads that are out there now too  and why did it take 5 years to find my official music videos that have literal millions of views on the official artist channel??
I love that 5 years after I posted the music videos to my first songs,
@cdbaby
 finally found them and is suddenly copyright claiming all of them on my own channel. Only took 5 years to sift through Content ID

I feel attacked
My artistic process for my personal work is... probably not the healthiest thing for my mental state  I’m starting to think these songs are not worth feeling so horrible for.
I love this so much!!  Your style is so dope! What the hecck!! https://twitter.com/nuirrrrrr/status/1216212675639808001…

On a related note: Discovered this week that I may be allergic to some makeup products  I hope it wasn’t the Mini because this is my first pallet ever.
The Conspiracy collection is what first got me to try a bit of makeup and though I missed out on the Conspiracy pallet I adore the Mini Controversy Thank you

Hey

 could ya hit me back about my very glitchy Matriarch? It’s unusable at this point even after the new firmware update and it’s been 10 days since I emailed about it  I absolutely love this synth but these bugs are driving me crazy!
So I just opened FNAF AR for the first time and the VERY moment it said “we’ve sent Freddy over to you!” I got alerts of motion at my front door and then the doorbell rang....!

Leave your comment for the FTC about COPPA here! https://regulations.gov/comment?D=FTC-2019-0054-0001…
Please if you make a post about the FTC and COPPA, link to the .gov sites of the policy and the .gov site to leave a public comment! Let your audience have the chance to find the answers for themselves if you want to educate them!
COPPA: https://ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions…
Having spoken to my team at Frederator as well as my team of entertainment and social media lawyers in the US, video game fandom channels like mine are NOT safe from this policy change because of “content inadvertently being appealing to kids” regardless of who it was made for.
This is NOT a policy made for television so if you are getting legal advice from people in television, you are not getting the whole picture. This is COPPA, it ONLY pertains to content ONLINE. While the FTC does also govern television, this is not about TV!
While I appreciate fellow creators putting their opinions out about COPPA. Some are making videos and posts about the policy but failing to see a need to be worried, not realizing they missed the most important phrase in the policy - “content appealing to kids”

If you’ve never heard this song, check out the music video here!
I found this old patch today and now I’m feeling #nostalgic  If you remember this song, you’re an OG K9!
I can’t be the only one that does this...right?
Wow this weekend is hitting the bank account really hard. First adpocolypse 2.0, then my macbook pro gets fried by a spilled drink, then I get another two flat tires on the way to replace the laptop.  Now I can finally use that emoji properly!

I’m here at the dentist office and I’m sweating because I’m so nervous  #GotPitStains
Now I get to spend today and part of this week in dentist chairs. I am not looking forward to this
Back in 2015 I fell off my longboard and this happened. My dentist gave me a temporary fix but said the broken teeth would need to be crowned in 4 years. Last night one of the fake tooth parts just fell out while flossing. WHY JANUARY??!?
Now I have to spend the next 90 minutes playing apps and watching YouTube videos while I wait for a tow truck...I guess it’s not all bad

I absolutely love this song from yesterday’s #StevenUniverse episode  #ChangeYourMind
It’s not fun being in love with a ghost who left your life years ago  When I see her in my dreams I wake up feeling like a ghost myself. I need to write a song about this feeling.
I thought I was being super clever remotely backing my car up into the garage so I wouldn’t get rained on. As soon as it parked beside me the windshield wipers turned on and flung water all over me

Success and money do not equal happiness. You can have everything you’ve ever wanted and still feel empty. Chasing a career can seem so necessary when you’re looking toward the future but love will always be the most important. #LessonsLearnedTheHardWay

I really like Depression: the Furry TV Show
When I opened up Google today, I was a bit caught by surprise when I saw Mister Rogers in place of the Google logo. So I clicked and noticed a very well-made stop-motion music video of his beloved song "Won't You Be My Neighbor?"

It was an amazing experience!
@MisterRogersSay
K9’s, I am almost speechless right now...  I’ve been dreaming of this day for a long time. Today I was able to make a dream into reality and I cannot thank everyone enough for helping make this happen!  You K9’s are so amazing!!

What is your dream car?
Do you ever file complaints against very rude customer service?
Looks like no new car today cause the dealership screwed up my loan application  I don’t like rude customer service especially when I’m being polite and they stubbornly double down on something they clearly messed up!
Buying a car is a pain in the bum. Why didn’t anyone tell me it was so complicated and takes so long?!
Never mind  They were booked up! The floof stays...for now
Time to get a trim! Or at least try to if my fav salon isn’t too busy!  The floof is too real right now!!
Today’s schedule might be too chaotic for a live stream! Something big is coming tomorrow and I’m scrambling to get ready!
BITCH HWHATTCY FFGGGG HT. HFJFJFJIFOOHGGG OH GGGG HH OHHHHH
When your Dream makes no sense
As you grow older and get more busy chasing your career, please remember take time to talk to your friends. Sometimes we forget how important friendship is. Don’t wait around for them to reach out first. Go talk to your friends. They miss you.

Using Premier on the new PC for the first time  OML it’s so much faster than my macs!
Why didn’t I switch to PC editing sooner?!
I mean it’s all going to get posted online anyways!  Maybe a bit better quality footage is scary to them???

That moment you realize that catchy hook you wrote for a friend’s song is actually already a hook in a J. Cole song...  Too bad though, it would’ve been a really sick hook.

One great but rare way to help out creators you love FOR FREE:

Contact your favorite con and ask them to invite them as a guest.

If invited, the creator might even get funding for the trip!! Or at least get a free artist alley table/con pass! It helps creators visit new places!

Sorry to keep tagging you guys
@TeamYouTube
 - but it appears most of my notified subscribers did not get any notification about our live stream that went on for over two hours today.  Getting a lot of complaints from subscribers right now.
Even your Creator Studio system shows it as a fully monetized video with no notifications anywhere about it being inappropriate for viewers. Something obviously isn’t right here.
Apparently YouTube is making it even harder for you to see new videos.

- hit the notification bell on your favorite channels as well as subscribe
- follow them in other platforms
- use your subscriber feed more than recommended
- retweet this so others see it.

Turns out I uploaded the wrong version of our new video, but I fixed it last night! Unfortunately in order to not be demonetized we have to keep it unlisted for over 24 hours  Sunday is the day everyone!! Patrons check your email later today though  #earlyaccess
Is the wait finally over tomorrow for our next song?  ...maybe... Stay notified, K9’s!
As I was watching the new YouTube Red show- “I’m Poppy!,” I was so shocked and confused. Is this show a commentary on what happened to Mars Argo??! She was one of my favorite singers... this is making me really sad
Literally just finished editing over 100 text layers and was on the end card of the video! I JUST NEED 10 SECONDS MORE!!! Now I have to redo it all!!!
Im so done with
@adobe
 After Effects. I can’t even get it to play back now. I’m at the very end of the video editing and it is totally corrupt now! Sorry everyone- “They’ll Keep You Running” is getting delayed.... Time to upgrade OSX to rebuild the entire project in Final Cut.
So I can’t figure out how to replace these lightbulbs in my house. I broke one while trying... good thing I wore gloves! Safety first!
youtube went ahead and changed their sub box to sort by ‘highlights’ instead of ‘most recent’  similar to what ig did in the past  be sure to change your settings back to most recent so you don’t miss your favourite creators videos!

If you made a video with my music and recently received a claim by Frederator - that is my MCN searching out for my content and claiming it like our music usage rules state! Not a false claim!

#DYK Flamingos have more in common with whales than other birds when it comes to feeding. That's because flamingos are filter-feeders! Complex rows of horny plates line their beaks which are used to strain food items, like crustaceans, from the water, much like baleen whales do.

 As predators and prey, snakes keep ecosystems in balance.

These past thirteen years working directly with animals has been an amazing ride. I have learned so much, lived so many amazing experiences, and worked alongside so many amazing people. But, it’s now time to put my skills to use in new ways.
As someone who grew up in a rural community, I know first hand how difficult it is for the majority of kids (and adults) to have access to these experiences. This is why I am so thrilled to be joining the team and begin work on making zoos and aquariums more accessible for all.
I believe everyone regardless of income level, location, or other factors should have the ability to meet the amazing animals we share this planet with and have the opportunity to grow into conservation heroes.
Zoolife is the world’s first virtual zoo; designed to bring guests closer to nature and offer innovative new ways of learning, protecting, and engaging with the natural world, from home. Streaming live from the world's top accredited zoos, sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers.
I am absolutely thrilled to share that I have accepted an exciting new role with

Glass frogs - a frog so transparent you don't even need an x-ray or MRI to see inside of them!
Tasmanian devils don't just exist in Looney Toons! The name for this little mammal originates from the first European settlers on the island state of Tasmania who heard mysterious growls and screams in the night.  This later encouraged the inclusion of "devil" in its.
The nearly five-inch-long tongue of a kinkajou allows them to expertly reach inside flowers or beehives for tasty honey or nectar
Aye-aye, Captain! The aye-aye is the only primate who uses a form of "echolocation".  They specifically listen for echoes to lead them to hollow areas in the trees, where they use their unusually long middle finger to hunt for insects inside the tree
Whitemargin stargazer lookin' up at ya  This species hangs out on coastal bottoms where it prefers to stay mostly buried under the sand with only their eyes showing. An oral lure hangs out to lure prey closer
This is your regular reminder that binturongs smell like buttered popcorn

The most shocking fact about mantis shrimp isn't their powerful punch. It's the fact they aren't even shrimp. They are stomatopods, distant relatives to crabs, shrimp, and lobsters.

This notoriously shy shark has a powerful secret tool - its tail. The thresher shark's tail makes up half of its body length and is used to stun its prey. By swiping their tail in a trebuchet-like motion, thresher's are able to hit fast enough to create a stunning shockwave
Meet the snake with eyelashes! The most distinguishing feature of an eyelash viper is the supraciliare, or enlarged scale, above each eye, giving the appearance of “eyelashes”. These eyelashes help the vipers blend in better with the surrounding foliage of their environment

I will personally be holding safety refreshers for all of my staff, volunteers, and interns to ensure we are prepared should (heaven forbid) this ever happen to us. To clarify, we do use all of the aforementioned safety tools and have backups, but it never hurts to be prepared!
Threatening the facility this happened at, harassing their staff, and general negativity does NOTHING to help this situation. What happened, happened. What is important is that the zoo and staff improve going forward.
It is clear the keeper messed up. It is clear safety protocols need to be reevaluated including having backup keepers on stand by so guests do not have to be involved. But, we should ABSOLUTELY recognize how this keeper was able to get herself out of this situation so easily.
That. Is. AMAZING.
Despite having her arm FULLY inside the gator’s mouth while it death rolls her in the water, the keeper still remains calm enough to instruct a guest to assist her. She walks the bystander completely through how to help her and later help himself out of the habitat.
Most people would scream and try to pull away from the gator. That’s not what this keeper did. Instead, she jumped into the water WITH THE GATOR, locked legs around it, and rolled with it. THIS takes guts and nerves of steel which was amazing to witness. This move saved her arm.
It only takes one moment of complacency where you are a TAD too comfortable for a mistake to happen with any animal. The keeper reached too close to the gator’s face to ask it to back up when the gator was already in a feeding response. We all know what happened next.
In this situation, none of these tools were being used - only hands and the keeper’s body. This particular training method has worked for them for a very long time. But, of course, that doesn’t mean it will always go smoothly - as indicated by the video floating around.
The wooden poles are used to guide the animal through gentle pressure on the tip of their snouts or on other areas. Target sticks serve as a visual cue to tell the animal where you want them to go. You can also teach alligators to station, come, and more through verbal commands.
Typically, when working with large crocodilians, multiple tools are utilized to ensure the safety of the zookeeper as well as to communicate effectively with the animal. This usually involves wooden poles, target sticks, and related devices.
Gators are capable of being trained to respond to verbal & visual cues. This form of training, often referred to as husbandry training, enables keepers to work safely with dangerous animals while minimizing the stress an animal may have during routines such as veterinary exams.
News has spread regarding a keeper in Utah who was bitten by an alligator they care for. While it is clear the keeper made a mistake & the facility's safety protocols need to be reevaluated, the keeper’s capability in the face of immense peril should be commended.

Here’s why
There are currently 201 known adult kakapos left in the world - each with their own name. All of them have been named by the Kakapo Recovery Program which extensively monitors the critically endangered birds. That's a BIG increase from 1995 when there were only 51 birds left.

Mmmm... tasty slug snack.

NOT REALLY THOUGH!

Banana slugs defend themselves by producing A LOT of mucus, causing their predators' mouths to be filled with GOOP. The goop is also an anesthetic, meaning it will make a predator's tongue and throat go numb

Velvet Ants, known as "Cow Killers", are actually parasitoid wasps. They get their name from the urban legend that their string is so painful it is able to kill a cow.
Known as the King of the cattail, male red-winged blackbirds will not hesitate to divebomb larger predators or even other birds. More than a quarter of each day is spent chasing off or at least pestering perceived threats.

Meet the polka-dot tree frog. Secretions along the frog's skin cause it to emit a greenish blue fluorescent glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. Because it is linked to secretions from glands in the skin, they can also leave fluorescent markings as they move
Although most people believe black mambas get their name from the color of their bodies, the name is actually because of the inside of their mouths. When threatened, the snake is quick to draw back into a striking position, and open the mouth to expose the black interior.

One of the activities involved learned how to setup a habitat for a reptile, like this little leopard gecko. The kids had so much fun decorating for him!

Amphibians and reptiles are slipping away faster than we can study them... or even teach about them

What a beautiful sheen!  This gorgeous dwarf reticulated python was surrendered to us a few months ago. Despite her smaller size, she still has just as fierce of a personality as her larger counterparts!

Bindi is a crocodile monitor who came to us through a government confiscation a few years ago. The species is shy and aggressive by nature, with these characteristics compounded in Bindi due to her background.

She gets better every day though under our care!

THANK YOU!

It has been SO disheartening today to see so many people belittling the sustainable actions we can take in our daily lives.

This isn't an either/or situation.

We should do everything we can to save our planet - the small and the big.
Fossil fuels are burning up our future. We need to make it clear to these corporations that sustainable, renewable energy sources are what we and this planet need.

It's not just Thailand going through this. The zoological based tourism industry around the world is suffering more than you may think. Accredited zoos, historic aquariums, privately owned ventures... We risk losing them more and more without increased financial support

P.S. Don't think that we don't notice those of you that are now tweeting "Happy Pride" as if a few weeks ago you weren't talking about how it was cringe  Funny how some of you start singing a different tune when it is now advantageous to you, huh?
As someone who grew up in a very close-minded and homophobic town, pride is a very much needed celebration. This is the one time of year a lot of us finally feel comfortable to be ourselves.

It is not cringe.

It is not stupid.

Anyone have any Twitch team recommendations? I have been working on being a part of Wild Abandon but was not able to get an application in quick enough for either of their openings. Feeling really discouraged and hope there may be some alternatives out there to help me grow.
Although this particular sign is not government issued nor official, the text in the bill is still just as bad. This is one of the most absurd things I have ever heard of or seen. Pictured here is what the "official" signage is most likely to look like.
Tennessee businesses who allow patrons to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity are now being forced to display discriminatory signs to "warn" others they may see trans people inside. All in thanks to HB 1182. This is disgusting.

I know I have angered people in the past about this. I have been called a fun ruiner or been told "you must be fun at parties".

I don't care what you think of me.

I will call out abuse as I see it.

Please stop reposting content from terrible, abusive facilities.
I don't what it is but furries are particularly bad with this. So many think "Aww, Cute!" and post without thinking about where the video was taken or at what context. Even if you are ripping the photo/video and reposting it "as your own", you are supporting them.
Anytime you repost, like, share, or interact in anyway with the content created by these Tiger King stars you are supporting this abuse.

STOP giving them the attention and support.

STOP perpetuating this suffering.
Since September 2020, the Department of Justice reports AT LEAST three big cat cubs died of malnutrition and two others died under "suspcious circumstances". The remainder are said to have suffered or died from being pulled from their mothers too early or fed improperly.
You know those memes y'all make about Tiger King? Those views you give that "documentary"? The jokes you make at the expense of their animals?

This is the type of person you are indirectly supporting.

No joke I have answered six surrender request emails for turtles, one for a leopard gecko, and one for a bearded dragon in just the past TWO DAYS from people who impulse bought them without realizing the minimal care they require
I am beginning to get a lot of QRTs and replies from people saying "but I did it and it's fine!"

If you're doing well with your impulse pet, you are the exception NOT the rule.

So much unnecessary suffering happens to animals at the hands of impulse buyers 99% of the time.
I cannot explain just how much gender euphoria I feel when I put on this suit
Providing safe outdoor experiences for cats does wonders for their happiness and wellbeing!  Since the weather was so gorgeous, we took one of our kitties, Nigel, out to our neighborhood trail to explore

Imagining how this little one traveled ALLLLL the way from a sunny farm in Florida or, even further, to Canada is so amazing. He now has a home with us and will be used to educate others about the impact of invasive species.
Cuban tree frogs represent a growing problem in warmer areas such as Florida. They are North America's largest tree frog species who, once established, can outcompete native species. The American green tree frog and the squirrel treefrog are rapidly disappearing because of them.
A little hitchhiker just arrived at my zoo!  While shopping at a plant store, a couple found this little Cuban tree frog and brought him to us. This species is native to Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands but is known to spread outside of their range via plant shipments.

Interested in reading the story of how two Boa constrictors were found abandoned on our doorstep the day before Christmas Eve? You can find the start of the thread here!
Where there is darkness, there is always light. We may not have been able to save the skinniest of the Christmas boas but her friend is still hanging on and has improved greatly! His wounds are healing, he eats every feeding, he takes baths, and he has lots of energy!
Update: I am very sad to share that we made the difficult decision to euthanize the skinniest of the two Christmas boas last month. She was showing no signs of improvement and began to decline, including no interest in eating. We tried our hardest. She passed peacefully.
To put some perspective to the situation in Canada right now: I am an essential worker living in a hot spot. I only JUST became eligible to book a vaccine at 8AM this morning. I get my first dose of the vaccine next week but don't get my second dose until the end of AUGUST.
I ask everyone to please be kind to your friends who do not live in the United States. While many in the states already have their second shot, many outside are still waiting for their first. The despair is high and your friends elsewhere need your support now more than ever.
After several months of unknowns, I am relieved to share that I was FINALLY able to book a COVID-19 vaccine appointment. It is a great feeling but I cannot help thinking about everyone who is still waiting for theirs. Thanks to
@VaxHuntersCan
 for helping us navigate this chaos.
This is the first time I have EVER been able to capture our two American Alligators, Lou and Toothless, bellowing to each other! Usually, they stop whenever I get close. I like to think they're shy
ALLIGATOR DUET!  When love is in the air, gators use bellows to communicate to mates. The amazing part? What you're hearing isn't all of it! They also produce calls that we can't hear but... can SEE! The water droplets dancing on their backs are caused by these infrasounds!

Happy #FurFestFriday! The key to winning some games is eye contact, and focus. #FursuitFriday
Hey Y'all. Who else(besides me) in the fandom are mental health therapists? I'm creating a list of contacts for my work as Mental Health/Spirituality/Nature track lead for
@FurFest
.  Please share this tweet! DM's are open.
It's #TipTuesday and many have recognized the delayed start to registration this year. Responding to attendee feedback, we have been hard at work revamping our opening process and do not have dates for you yet. We appreciate your patience and ask that you check back next Tuesday!
Happy #FurFestFriday! We love our charities dearly and are curious to hear your favorite memories of them. What about your favorite fundraising methods? Your favorite fundraising critters?
Happy #TipTuesday! We do not have any dates for you this week, but volunteers are making progress and our 2019 website has been updated. For those who wish to apply as Dealers, please take a moment to read over the relevant FAQ found there: http://ow.ly/bLpn50uHf9u
Happy #FurFestFriday! Don't feel blue!  MFF is months and months away, but we suspect it will be here before you realize it!
Happy #TipTuesday! We do not have any dates for you this week.  Our volunteers from Dealers, Registration, Hotel and more, are hard at work to open this year's departments as soon as possible.
Hey
@FurFest
 digging through old things, thought you might get a kick out of this.
Happy #FurFestFriday! Did you see we had full sized video games last year?  How frickin' awesome is that?!? (Note: "Full-sized" is relative to the size of the machines, not the size of the furs playing them.)
And just to clarify, we do not have any dates for you this week.  Our Dealers, Registration, Hotel, etc. volunteers are hard at work to open this year's departments as soon as possible.
You're welcome!
Many people are excited about this year's event, and worried about missing a major announcement. Moving forward, we'd like to help out by setting aside #TipTuesday for all special deadline-related announcements. So if you only check our posts once each week, Tuesday is the day!
Happy #FurFestFriday! Do you love video games?  Why not check out our video gaming this year and show off your skills, while making friends who share your passion!
From all your friends at Midwest FurFest, we hope you have a safe and meaningful Memorial Day.
Happy #FurFestFriday! From A/V, to DJ's, to programming and hotel staff, it takes a surprising amount of time and effort to make our dances come together. We hope you enjoy the heck out of 'em!
Happy #FurFestFriday! TFW: Somebody else is getting all the attention, just because they don't know how stringed lights work... #FurSuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! With seven months until MFF 2019, who are you excited to see?!  #FursuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! Nightly dances are a great way to celebrate life, friends, and the fandom as a whole.
MFF Social Media Team here! Convention Registration and Hotel Reservations are still busy finalizing important details. We promise to provide you with information in a timely manner and give you plenty of notice, once a date is set.
Happy #FurFestFriday! Gaming is a great way to find people who share your passions, or take a break and relax. However you make use of our gaming spaces, have fun!
Happy #FurFestFriday! There's no "right way" to enjoy a convention, just so long as you do. We try to make that easier with many flexible use areas throughout the event space.
Just for this I dove into my pic bin, these are some pics from
@Furfest
 2002. Yeah, these were pretty much the parade suits that year. Having a fursuit meant you knew someone or you made it yourself out of what you had.

Either way, we were all designers of our own suits, really.
Happy #FurFestFriday! We suspect games like this are much shorter when played with cats. #FursuitFriday
Our account is going black for the evening, in honor of
@dogbomb1
, an amazing person who has inspired so many in this fandom. We encourage all of you to make a donation, no matter how small, to http://alsa.org to help find a cure. ALS can kiss our fuzzy butts!
Happy #FurFestFriday! Lines are unavoidable, and we are working hard to minimize them this year. However, everything is better with friends! Do you have any favorite memories which were created while waiting in line?
Ok, ok furballs! Our joke hit too close to home for some, so to avoid further confusion (and frustration for our hotel staff), we pulled it down.  ...happy April Fools.
Please check back later this month for more information on this year's room lottery!

Happy #FurFestFriday! It has been said the point of modern art is to inspire an emotional response. What emotion does this bring out in you?
Happy #FurFestFriday! Nobody rocks like furries do. (Mostly because it's kind of crazy to dance your tail off while wearing a carpet... and tail) But we love it and we love you! #FursuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! Photos like these always amuse us social media staffers... Who has the flip-side of this? #FursuitFriday
Happy #FurFestFriday! However you express the animal within, we love to see your creativity flourish at Midwest FurFest!
Happy #FurFestFriday! We know the time between now and MFF feel about as long as the Habitrails®, but we hope to start making announcements regarding this year's event in about a month.  (Late March, early April.) #FursuitFriday

Listen, MFF Social Media Team here AGAIN to talk about business casual. Just pretend you're boring people. Like, RP as a business traveler here for a business convention. Until Wednesday night. Please? We good?
*sighs*  Your MFF Social Media team now realizes that our tweet about pants being part of business casual was made with the mistaken assumption that attendees would also be wearing shirts with them. We regret the error.
Your MFF Social Media Team would like to apologize for any uncertainty with regards to our previous tweet, but would like to clarify that business casual does indeed still include pants.
To our early attendees; Please keep in mind that until 7PM Wednesday, we are sharing the Hyatt with business guests. The Hyatt has always been accommodating and respectful to us, so please help us return that respect and maintain a "business casual" atmosphere until then.

Please note: you'll need to be fully vaccinated by the first day of the con, which is 2 weeks after the last dose. We will post reminders to assist in planning.
Information on how we will be checking attendee vaccination will be released at a later date.

In addition, information regarding legally required exceptions to vaccination will be provided within the coming days.
Info regarding #BLFC2021 attendance

TL;DR

Vaccine is REQUIRED to attend
Masks are REQUIRED per state regulations

Changes to how con events and amenities operate may change to comply with any future safety regulations.

We hope to see you in Neo-Reno soon!
If you previously booked a room at the Nugget for 2020, there looks to still be room for you at the GSR! Please forward your Nugget confirmation to hotel@goblfc.org and we will get you set up.
Citizens of Neo-Reno, don't forget to sign up for our cyberpunk inspired Fashion Show!

RE: #BLFC2021 HOTEL ROOMS

If you had a con block room reservation for the original BLFC2020 dates but cancelled, an email has been sent with an offer to rebook your room.
While all our attendees are epic with a lower case “e”, not all can be Epic with a capital “E”.

Upgraded registration levels - Epic, Patron and Sponsor - are all sold out.
Please be advised we anticipate little, if any, room inventory will remain after recipients of the below-referenced email act upon the offer to rebook their original room.
RE: #BLFC2021 HOTEL ROOMS -

If you had a con-block room reservation for the original BLFC2020 dates but canceled it, you will receive an offer on Friday, July 30, to re-book your room for our Oct 2021 dates. Be sure to check your email!
If you are planning to attend #BLFC2021 and do not - and have not ever - had a con block hotel room booked (for either 2020 or 2021), your best bet now is to seek out friends with room space available. It is unlikely you will be able to book a room yourself.
Also get vaccinated
#̶B̶L̶F̶C̶2̶0̶2̶0̶ #BLFC2021 is only a few months away! Don’t forget your:
- Travel arrangements

- List of things you want to buy from vendors
- COVID-19 vaccination
Please look for an email dated 3/21/21, from noreply@goblfc.org. We generated these emails from a list the hotel sent us. Passkey will _not_ show the updated date.
If you can't find the 3/21 email, please call 1-800-648-5080 with your name and confirmation number to confirm.

 ...
E-mail confirmations for movement of con-block room reservations to our new dates have been going out.  Be sure to check the email you originally used when reserving your room, including any bulk mail folders.
Re: Room reservations:

Original Passkey reservation numbers will not show your updated reservation information, so using old emails to check on your reservation won’t work.

Do know that we are able to see most all reservations have been moved, and you’ll get confirmation soon.
We don't yet know what state/local requirements will be for large gatherings in October, nor what policies will be in place then.

For now, one should operate under the assumption masks will be required in public spaces, and vaccination will be required for travel and attendance.
Vaccine eligibility is expanding across the country. We highly encourage you to get vaccinated when able. Doing so may be required for travel, hotel check-in, attendance for a variety of events in the future. Getting your vaccine will ensure you're prepared and protected.
Please wait at least a couple weeks before attempting to book an off-block room for our new dates. In order to allow time to move all con-block reservations, any attempts to book off-block right now will just yield "sold out" results.
Announcing #BLFC2021’s new dates: October 21-24, 2021!
Important announcement re: #BLFC2021:
Please consider supporting Kelcema Audio via their GoFundMe.  They’ve been a fixture of cons for years now, and essential to cons’ dance and production experiences; the cancelation and suspension of conventions through this last year has hit them hard.

Just in case anyone had missed it - BLFC will not be taking place this weekend!

Have a safe and happy Halloween, vote early, and we hope to see you in June 2021!

By now, many of those holding an in-block reservation for BLFC2020 should have received an email from the GSR about your reservation being moved to BLFC2021.  If you haven't yet seen this email, keep an eye out for it arriving shortly (and an eye on your spam/bulk mail folder).

BLFC2020 was originally scheduled to begin this week, but has been rescheduled for the end of October.

To make getting through this convention-less weekend easier, though, why not let the miracle of Photoshop put you in Reno and at the GSR?!
Reno area furries are covering up and staying safe - and stylish!

Left over swag bandanas from prior convention years were delivered to local furs to use as masks and face coverings and help flatten that curve.

Stay home, furries! And if you have to go out, cover up!
While #BLFC2020 has been postponed until October, the Save Haven Wildlife Sanctuary - a BLFC charity for several years - is caring for animals year-round.  If you have the money to spare, we’d love it if you considered donating!

*HUUUUUUUUUUGS*

We  you and everyone else at the GSR!
You currently may not change your reservation to our new dates, or book new ones on our new dates, *precisely because they are holding all rooms and inventory for the migration, as well as dealing with current casino closures*.  Be patient and understanding.  Thank you!
If you have an off-block reservation, please also wait a few weeks at least before trying to call the GSR to move your reservation. Rooms will be available in October, but they are far too busy to make reservation changes right now. Attempt to make changes online if able.
BLFC2020 attendees: Please understand our room block migration will take some time. We ask that you not call the GSR to attempt to move your reservation yourself, as hotel reservations and support staff will be very busy. Let us and the GSR handle your room migration as planned.
With regards to con block reservations: as some inventory may become available over the next few weeks, we will announce details on booking later.

If you wish to transfer a room reservation name (i.e., keep room, but put it in friend's name) please wait til after date migration.
Answering recurring questions -

-  Early Bird registration pricing for #BLFC2020 will be extended. Stay tuned for details.
- Patron/Epic levels are limited supply (due to limited supply of swag); is contingent upon how many of said reg level types free up over the next weeks.

Friendly reminder - our line management system works best if you catch elevators from the spa level in order to go up to rooms on higher floors.  Elevators prioritize the spa level, and service elevator escorts work from spa level.

Thank you all for your understanding!

During peak elevator use periods we also have volunteers escorting groups of people to the service elevators, from spa level and going up.
Please no congregating or smoking in the stairwells.
GSR security is being exceptionally nice and letting us use the central stairwell. Please do not ruin their generosity :3
Also feel free to use a different elevator and then take stairs for a few flights.
Please do not try to use the stairwells at the end of hotel wings; they are still exit-only.
Due to elevator overloading, the central staircase will be staying open. Please feel free to use the stairwells for any short trip between a few floors.

#BLFC2019
Your snazzy red Sponsor/Patron/Epic  (and blue staff) swag elixir bottles have a protective plastic strip on the inside of the lid. Be sure to remove it before loading up on free Coke Freestyle drinks at Port of Subs!  Also remove the paper info card inside.They don’t taste good.
Advice to all
@BiggestLittleFC
 Sponsors & above who get the stainless steel water bottle:

1. Before you wash it, remove the small piece of paper inside
2. Remove the small piece of plastic inside the lid
3. It fills up FAST at Port of Subs and you can’t see how full it is. #BLFC
Registration is now open!

All Adventurers can now pick up their badges in the Nevada Room.

Our podcast continues!
Ah, the big city! What shenanigans can our country bumpkin Adventurers get up to in the next episode of the podcast.

There are those who you don't want to ever meet in a dark alley.

Or a brightly lit alley.

Or any sort of confined area between buildings really.

Find out what happens to those people in the next episode of our podcast.

(Hint: the rogue did it.)
If/when you email them, it helps to include...

- what it’s made of/what materials it uses
- its size, scale
- pictures of it, if possible

Thinking of buyin' a room reservation off a scalper?

*smacks your hand away*

Don't! Doing so could result in losing your room, and your money! With a scalped room, all that's guaranteed is you'll pay way too much money, for way too much risk and uncertainty.
If you have not received the notification email for the Group 1 room drawing, you can go to https://hotel.goblfc.org to see whether or not your entry was picked - click the Sign in With BLFC link to sign in to the account with which you entered the drawing.
Group 2 entries begin December 17th!

Thank you all for entering, and for joining us on our 2019 campaign!
Winners will have to Dec. 16th to use their Passkey link to book a room; a refundable (if canceled) deposit of first night’s rate plus taxes and fees will be charged at booking; unused entry selections will be returned to the pool of available rooms.
Email notifications for Group 1 room drawing results are being sent out. Please check your inbox (including spam/bulk folders, just in case).  You may also login at https://hotel.goblfc.org to see if your entry was selected and to verify.
Remember, you are under no obligation to use the booking link. You may hand it off to someone else, but they will see all of your personal info, so please be cautious. All unused rooms roll over to the next wave.

Any additional info can be found at http://goblfc.org/hotel
If you did get a winning email and the site isn’t showing a booking link, please email regdev@goblfc.org so they may fix the issue.

The booking links will be good all week, until the next drawing starts, so you don’t need to reserve right away!
To clear up some confusion:

Everyone who entered the room drawing will get an email declaring if you were selected or not. Emails are still going out, so please hold tight while everybody gets notified.

For those that got in, the site has been updated to reflect that.
For those who were selected for a room, the site is experiencing an issue. Please bear with us while a fix is coming. Our apologies for the delay.

#BLFC18
Someone just have an answer...
My #BiggestLittleFurCon #photos are now online at my SmugMug.

@BiggestLittleFC
Should note that on the website are the credits for the vocals and participants on the CD that was sold and not the live show which had some cast that was different.
So... How many of you liked the musical!?

If you haven't already, why not take a moment to acknowledge all the people who made it possible!

The credits has people I didn't even think would contribute. So many people...

#BLFC18
I predict that
@BiggestLittleFC
 had attendance of at least one (I was there) and less than 8 billion people.

Leaning toward much much less than 8 billion, but can't be for certain!

@BiggestLittleFC

WE'RE NOT ALL GONE YET!!!
Hey, even more fursuiters!

How are you still here?!

I love it!
18) In the future:  Slow down!  Think about the sources of your information.  Don’t spread rumors.  Don’t attack people on twitter.  Give the benefit of the doubt when you hear a situation has been handled:  You will never have all the information if your only source is hashtags.
Hey! Found fursuiters still going strong today. This is a good thing.
Please be advised: An accident has shut down the ramps from 395N to I-80 (east and west).  If you need to get on to I-80 you may want to consider alternate routes - and drive safely!
Remember to give yourself some extra time if/when heading to the airport!  While it’s just a short ride and
@grandsierra
 has free shuttles running back and forth, a large crowd of fellow departing con goers could mean a bit of a wait for shuttle space.
@BiggestLittleFC

There's a plane, bound to fly you off to somewhere, back to the inside of my phone...

Safe travels to everyone who came to #BLFC18. We'll be seeing ya!
*fade out*
No, I won't say goodbye.
And I don't want to hear you say it either.
Only time can keep us apart now.
So, I won't say goodbye.
But, I can tell you, it was a Good Con.

#BLFC18
Sad that #BLFC18 has ended?

Don’t be, because it hasn’t!  There’s more music and dancing to be had in the Main Stage!

Because this adds complexity I can't ALWAYS promise the comic will update at midnight precisely. Some days, pages will just have to be done when they're done. Sometimes I'll swap or bump pages from other comics depending on what's in the pipeline.
Housepets has priority, meaning it should be updating AT LEAST once/week, sometimes more. We also have a new production pipeline, as
@KyleSmeallie

@KaeEsrial

Your all valued. I value you. I appreciate your life. And I appreciate your existence. Every step you take in life is just making you get closer to the greatness I know your all capable of achieving. You all will do amazing things in life. I know it
Hey everyone. Been a rough few days. But I needed to vent some shit out. Now it's time to share some love and spread positivity. Your all important. No matter what you think of yourself you are important. Everyone may be bad at shit. But that doesn't make you lessor
Just not my week rn.. all this pc shit had me really upset and I thought it would be fun to maybe get on vrchat and hang out with my friends to relax and get this stuff off my mind. Hanged out for a bit and then everyone left into a pc only world. Made things worse honestly
Okay okay so get this. I call

I'm Nina (Aka Cookie) Your dumb proto girl ^^

Fun fact! You can't steal other people's art and characters and then sell them as NFTs. You need permission first.

Not just that, NFTs are useless. Waste of money and electricity.
Hates furries, these are some of the reasons why. Maybe if we actually thought before we spoke and did things we wouldn't have this problem.
Furry discord server owners: "Why do we get raided so often?"
Furry Twitter: *awful drama, zoophiles trying to get in, like 30 people being called out for being pedos, the really really weird people, and annoying memes just there*

Yes that is actually why. One of my friends

Consent is everything. It doesn't matter of it's sexual or not, all parties MUST consent.
My personal favorite staff rule.
I am so unbelievably hurt by the state of the furry fandom (especially on here)

Are all of you looking for a reason to be hated on by the entire community because all I see is big accounts being targeted. Is there nothing better to do?

YouTube is slowly becoming every single platform.

YouTube has community posts, similar to tweeting. Just without the character limite

You can stream on YouTube

You can posts shorts, which are like TikToks.

4. The community is supposed to be welcoming to people who are at least decent people.
5. Furries are still people.
6. Not all furries are cringe, some simply just like anthropomorphic animals/creatures

If you don't like furries just mute the term and people. It's not that hard.
I'm saying this, send this to anyone who claims all furries are zoophiles or is just hating.

1. No, we hate zoophiles.
2. The NSFW art is surprisingly common no doubt, but the community isn't all about porn
3. The community is intentionally cringe, it's supposed to be fun.
Favorite things to do on twitter:
#1 Tell zoophiles they aren't welcome in the furry community
#2 Block all zoophiles
People who shade refs:
[small shot]
Dress codes exist because of perverted people.
Retweet to scare people with NFTs
You are a [BIG SHOT]

Just saying, if I every do a face reveal, no matter how many people say I look great, I will always see myself as ugly.

I don't like the way I look.

My tweets are concerning.
52 unchecked notifs xd
My school blocked socialblade lol
200 tweets so far today lol!
You literally cannot be spooky just because of how absolutely adorable you are!
You're German. That's the compliment.
You seem to be like that one person you met just on a walk. You're very friendly but you never really get the same friendliness back.

Keep being friendly!
Time to use the activity feed on tweetdeck to speedrun meeting new people. :D
You seem like a person who would randomly go around and give people who seem sad hugs
If the entire population were allergic to cuties, we'd all sneeze on the sight of you.
I'm just giving out random compliments to people. Like odd ones no one would use.
Keep in mind Twitter has auto-moderation. It DOES NOT take context into anything. If your tweet seems to break the rules, the auto-moderation system will give you a punishment based of the rule broken.

Be careful what you tweet, because it's automated.
I'm going to reply to every single person who replies to this tweet.

:3
I don't think I need to say how dumb this is.

Hey breasties!
Furry Twitter not having drama for 24 hours challenge! (Impossible)
Fun fact!

Small artists are sometimes better than the bigger artists.
I just finished a unit test in 30m and I'm sitting here looking around and NO ONE ELSE IS DONE.

I'm either correct or really wrong on the test. Lol
Bro. Why was it so cold last night -_-

Hey hey!

Just a reminder I'm not on every platform. The list below will include my username on any websites I am on.

Protogens gave just become the copy and paste species of the furry fandom and it's disappointing.

Like mine doesn't follow the lore or anything, hell mine doesn't even have any of the body armor anymore.

I remember over a year ago protogens were far and few between. So I guess I'm one of the cool protogens since I was one before everyone was like, haha beep boop unoriginal!
Bio teachers are always poggers
We need less protogens and more of everything else.
Failed sleep. Anyways just a reminder @/PawsCyro was DM promoting ProtoHub.

If anyone on there is using my sona, it's not me as I refuse to join it.
Goodnight!

The fact this video got over 200k views on YouTube is concerning to say the least.
Wait...

Is that a Deltarune meme?
Just a reminder to

We all love and support you, if you ever need to talk to someone you've got a whole community at keyboards ready to help.

Grow up and stop saying Xbox or PlayStation is better. All platforms are equal.
It happened! Lol
I'm bored so...
Add me on Snapchat!
Twitter releases a new feature, your 3rd image is what you think of it.
I know I'm not at artist, but, it's okay to trace art as long as it's for fun and you don't claim it or use it as your own. The issues come from when you use it and even go as far as saying you made it.

Don't trace art if you're going to use it publicly, just commission them.

Hi, I'm awake simple to say, this is actually a correct way to draw my sona.

Yes, Cookie has 4 eyes.
Yes, she can have 2 eyes.
How does this make sense? Just close 2 eyes lol

Ok night for real I'm tired
Goodnight.

Yes this is a real thing in terraria.
Video delayed until tomorrow, I'm not feeling 100%, I want to make sure the video is as good as possible.

Apologies.
Update: my toe hurts.
If blue replies to this I will intentionally stub my toe.

Yo! I'm going to be uploading again starting THIS WEEK! (Today) please check out my channel and drop a sub if you like my content, it would help me out a ton!
I'm just going to tag 2 random people and automatically have 2 people hate me.

Day...

Y'know what.
@BlueFolf
 I'm done with asking for a shoutout... instead... day 1 of asking for a cuddle from fluffy blue girl
I'm going to hold off on the double uploads until 2022. I need to get consistent with editing and have a way to get into video creation again. I'll try to do 3 - 4 videos a week rather than 2 per day. Once Jan 2022 is here I'll start making double uploads.
Hot take
Protogens.
Question!

What games do you like?
Hippity hoppity your mom is my property.
I have 2 responded to my girlfriend when she messages me and they are

"I'm shitting" and "I'm laying in bed"
Hey twitter.

I'm giving people a chance to win 1 month of discord nitro classic on my discord server The Hug Zone!

All you have to do is invite the most people in the next 14 days!

Hmu in DMS for an invite!

This spooky month is not spooky yet. Disappointed.
Horny people have 2 main word sin their vocabulary. Cum and sex.

They just smash those 2 words in a sentence and leave.
Random thoughts I've had

Femboys are overrated.
Protogens are annoying 90% of the time
Moths are rare but highly overrated
Bad Protogen jokes are annoying
Being trans comes with a lot of problems.
Me irl
So uh. Just went on a banning spree from a bunch of raider ID dumps on discord.

Turns out strix was a server raider lol
I-
You wake up to this, what's crashing into the earth?
Ask my anything about my sona.
Spookie
If you want to know how I respond quickly sometimes. TweetDeck.
What's your sexuality? I'm interested.
Spread this own around
*visible concern*
Real quick. What are your pronouns?
opinions?
Ok everyone my mommy said I'm not allowed to be trans therefore I am not woman apparently.

Lmao my parents are dumb

Fun fact! I run a discord server! You should like join it

I will never forget the time I said I failed no nut November in October.

@BlueFolf
 forgot to ask for that daily shoutout for awhile,I forgot what one im on. What am I at now?
NFTs are quite literally a way for rich people to waste money.
Another dumb trend on furry twitter? Gimme some of that
Spoo...
Even people in jail don't accept pedophiles.
IT IS DA SPOOKY MONTH!
Reasons why being a protogen sucks:

You get called a toaster once every 20 minutes to a hour.

Beep.

Help I am stuck in your basement and I need food.

People should use scheduled tweets more often to be consistent. I can quite literally tweet every hour and make tweets and change them when I'm ready. Hourly tweet gang?
I opened YouTube to Lancer. What the hell.
The undo tweet feature is useless. You can edit scheduled tweets... What were the people at twitter thinking?
This is a tweet. Yeah short break I know, but, most my tweets are scheduled until I can be on twitter as much as I was previously.
It is the time when I wake up. Morning. Next tweet will be in 2h 45m from this tweet. Anyways have kris
I know all the lyrics to Chug jug with you and I'm scared.

Anyways back to break, I am going to be chillin on the cord for a while.
Dumb Bass
Deltarune keeps invading my timeline and I'm not against the memes.
I know I'm supposed to be on break, but seriously, I need more friends that I play games with and talk to on a daily (or semi-daily) basis.
I'm going to take a short break until I can handle myself again because I've been having depressive episodes a lot lately. Not because of twitter, though. Shit just went to shittier shit and I can't mentally handle it.

Might work on videos to try and take my mind off things QwQ
This is possibly goodbye. Idk

First 4 memes and stuff, feel free to steal.
My sona cookie does not wear pants. Ever.
I'll do my best to make sure strix either changes or decides to never come back. One or the other no inbetween.

Please continue to pay respects to our friend stixx who passed away, don't shine anymore light on this situation. I'm dealing with it.
Also for anyone curious to why I even care about strix, it's not because I care as much as I'd rather not have someone take their own life. Until I know strix isn't going to do anything harmful to themselves I'm going to just talk.

I have advised strix to stay off twitter
I'll deal with strix, everyone go back to doing whatever. No need for drama alright?

I'm tired of drama so anytime someone does something bad I'll hop in and talk to them and do my best to discipline them.
Certified bruh moment.
Your twitter account gets suspended! Your 2nd image is why.
What if I made the exact same generic tweet again lol
Matt
90% of the furry community
I am once again reminding you that zoophilia is not a real sexuality and is a crime.
You know, people can use light mode of they want to.

Just refrain from sending screenshots at 3 AM if you do use light mode.
I like how people draw protogens being this epic cyborg being and mines like:
Retweet if you're older than the legendary game Minecraft
Normal.
Oh you thought I was only going to do 1 horny check? 1st image. Right now.
No context
Choose your side.

Reply and I'll rate your profile out of 10! It's for a video xd
Hey
@BlueFolf
 Sometime during the next month we should totally make a video together!
Completely neutral morning! :3
This afternoon into tomorrow afternoon I will be working on several videos so I can keep up on the double uploads. 36 days worth of videos :D
Imma do it again! Reply and I will 100% guarantee  a reply back.

Cringe check. First meme, now.

My mom just told me being trans is a mental disorder and a choice.

That in itself is contradictory.

How could it be a mental disorder if it's a choice?

It's neither!
2.2k already? Crazy. Feels like everyday I go up 100. Thanks everyone :D
I've said progen so much that protogen gets autocorrected to progen
Your video is ready. Do you want it removed? contact @/LuisMayoV

I previous said I would reply to everyone that replies, now I will like every reply! (And occasionally reply)

I love how so many people have amazing pfps and sonas and I'm like

Haha progen go beep
Okay, anyone who replies to this I will draw a stick person in any color of your choice.

Hex values and RGB values accept as well as color names.

Looking for terms to mute, DM me a few and I'll start adding them. I want to make my twitter experience better.
Horny check! First image, now.

Might text my parents to come out. Scared as hell to type anything.

Day 2 of begging
@BlueFolf
 for a shoutout.
Although I don't like NSFW content on my profile, if a NSFW account follows me I'm not going to say anything unless they post porn or sexually explicit content somewhere where I will see it (such as on my posts). Their profile is their profile.
Since my notifications are constantly at 20+ because I made banger tweets again. Send an image to me in DMs and I'll rate it.

MUST BE SFW!
Hit the  button if you're older than Twitter!
I have reached this year
remember to follow because I must pass my girlfriend in follows.
@BlueFolf
 What about you?
Look at this gay baby lmao
Why did you become a furry? Making a video on this xd
No longer replying to everyone, my notifications are going crazy because of another banger tweet qwq

2,000! On a Tuesday! That means double uploads for another 30 days! Didn't actually think that was going to happen. Keep an eye out for a Poggers tweet later xd
I check twitter while on my break at work and I'm 7 away from 2,000. Holy shit everyone is crazy love you all!
Already about 25 followers away from 2,000? Yesterday and today has been absolutely crazy!
Yo
@BlueFolf
 why do you never check discord?
I'm going to tweet this everyday until it happens.

Day 1 of begging
@BlueFolf
 for a shoutout
I turned on twitter notifications on my phone. It's going to break.
me waiting for the
@BlueFolf
 shoutout xd
These stupid challenged are more fun than making videos. So I'm going to make videos on the stupid challenges.
Alright, new day, new stupid challenge.

Reply and I will message you (if your DMs are open)

Fair warning twitter will likely limit my account after a nice few messages so if I stop starting DMs, you know why.
I'm gonna point out something.

For me, if you walk up to me and say "hey man!" I'll be okay with it and I won't correct you. Mostly because saying hey man has no direct relation to my gender identity.

Now saying "You are a man" is a different story. That's just being mean.
Your twitter account gets suspended! The 2nd image you have saved is why.
100+ notifications and I went through every single one. Good morning!
Hey all! It's really late for me now and I need sleep, regardless of my fursona I am a human being afterall. I still need to take care of myself. Goodnight, I'll reply to everyone tomorrow when I wake up! Feel free to DM me nice messages as well uwu
Thank you to the 41 people who have followed so far today. Today has been crazy is a good way!
Update It's no longer possible to reply to everyone, please DM me your reply immediately as I cannot scroll far enough to see all tweets.
Skipping double uploads today and tomorrow, too busy. I'll add the 2 days I skip on the end of the 7 days I promised.
That's if I don't reply within 3 hours!
heads up! if you didn't see my QRT some replies don't show, and I am having trouble loading them, please send me the link to your reply and I'll get back to you asap!
Heads up! Due to the high amount of replies I'm having trouble loading some, if I don't get to you, DM me your reply and I'll reply immediatly (or as soon as I see it)
Just finished replying to 20+ people xd

Something I can agreewith
it's his brand
This is likely fake and to scare people.
Just went through
@Matty_Proto
's morning tweet and replied to everyone lol
I will reply to everyone who replies to this.
100% THIS
HELLO DREAM TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR YOUR FANS
IF YOU TOLD THEM TO EAT THEIR OWN SHIT FOR PROTEIN THEY WOULD SO TELL THEM TO STFU ABOUT DREAMGENDER AND DREAMSEXUAL
My great nan's strawberry jam.

Always put in a jar like this one.
I wonder if I can get to 2000 followers before october.
When you don't realize sex doesn't mean gender. Also sex changes exist. https://twitter.com/BeniiTreyvon/status/1439786661030752257…

Honestly, these days you can barely  tell a joke from seriousness. People joke about darker things and are like haha funny.

Sometimes tone indicators are required because jokes aren't apparent. Even for me, and I have a decent sense of humor, yet even I can't get some jokes.
There's a chance that I won't be able to do 2 uploads today. If that's the case I will just push it a day later.
Morning lmao
The fact that there's a Nintendo character named "Dry Bowser" which is just a Bowser made of bones implies that regular bowser is wet.
Another new upload!
My content creation dreams can be crushed by one of 2 things. My awful upload schedule or massive boobies.
New video up!
Alright homosexuals, which one are you?
Nothing suspicious here.
Man if I had a video editor I could do 2 videos a day easily.
Thumbnail 2.png
Thumbnail.png
Okay, double uploads for a week.
Good morni-

I'll start making videos now.
Also you may flex you CookieProtogen follow here. I only follow 150 people rn, and I will never follow more than 200. So yeeeeeah
You have until 12:00PM in my timezone to get me to 1900. otherwise your only chance for double uploads is on Tuesday
Update: Y'all failed
Y'all got like 15 minutes
No followers yet... It's also only been 16 minutes and you have like 4 hours...
Hmmm.... If I get to 1900 before I get home from work I will do double uploads for 7 days on YouTube. That's 14 videos in a week which is a lot of work.

If I reach 2000 by the end of Tuesday (21 Sept.) I will do double uploads for a month. Wish me luck if this happens...
Have fun editing this in any way you want. If I get enough edits I might make a video reviewing them xd

I hate this tweet
I can finally retire from funky friday haha

I for some reason could not FC this for the life of me and it's not even that hard
I own a discord server, but if you want to be updated on the server construction check out
@zone_hug
! I don't post things bout the server on my main account anymore xd
Y'all follow me but none of you DM me. Sadge
apparently there will be a 3rd vaccination here lezz go more needle in arm poggers
Retweet if you like using people, specifically in minorities for clout and internet like :D https://twitter.com/FluffyArcticFox/status/1438901193342812167…
*horny post*
Bed wars just sounds like sexual intercourse with extra steps
Just learned a british person goes to my school. Day ruined.
Do you like it when I tweet like 400 - 500 times a day? (Including replies.)
No one has questioned my location... :3

Hot Roblox character
I love my new bio specifically for the last little bit of it
Also this is the final part of this tweet, I was going to say something interesting but this is literally for my ref, it will be updated soon so temporary tweet until it's ready! ^^

Also this is just an edited version of my old ref to update the information xd
Although I accept gift art, please make sure it's SFW and not candy gore. I will refuse to accept it and will likely block you. There's an image attached to help you know what I accept and what I do not accept.
I'd prefer if you don't come to me for roleplay, I've never been all that big on RP, but I will occasionally do small things like a hug and stuff.

I am on discord, but I don't add people all that often. You can try to add me, Nina #0001
I know people like to ask for age and stuff, just know I prefer to not say my age publicly online.

I don't accept NSFW content and I usually block NSFW/Suggestive accounts, please keep your NSFW art and stuff out of my DMs.

Speaking of DMs my DMs are always open, message me!
I'm going to work on my pinned now. :)
I wonder if I can go positive in followers this month. I lost ~30 until I started using twitter again. Would be funny
Heads up, I was going to make a video today,but I strained my voice way too much yesterday and it hurts to talk. Might have to delay it until tomorrow or later.
My activity feed died. Rare occurrence!
Just saying since
@SpringyDotPng
 is my gf that makes me Momma Cookie. :3
I like calling women hot
Seeing people make gift art for other people who they either like or are having a hard time is one of the best things I've ever seen in this fandom. It's one of the few things that really keep me around, just people being nice to people. Hard to find good things on twitter.
Hear me out, what if I said good afternoon instead of good morning right now?
Okay night

Reply to this if ______
I'm going to take a short break from twitter, just an hour or two, and I'll come back after and start being active again. Don't ask why I'm active in testing something
I must've made 500+ tweets and replies today lol
Casually just went through at least 500 notifications that I had built up over the course of my school day. Tip for anyone looking to break their notifications, use tweet deck and follow at least 50 people, use the activity feed and boom, interaction but you actually try.
I want to be added to a bunch of lists for fun so you should do that lol
I have reached over 100 notifications several times today. more than 400 unchecked notifications... except I checked them... Tweetdeck op (reloading the page resets the count to 15 - 20)
I want to say something serious for once (again)

If you have religious beliefs, even though I don't believe in any religion or gods, feel free to express your religion to me (respectfully) I don't mind learning about religions!
Fun fact: You can see tweets of people who block you through tweetdeck. All you need is someone to interact with their tweet and you can see it. You can't reply, like, retweet or anything, but you CAN see it.
retweet this dog immediately
Is lunch time
I love 15 minute breaks in school.
I don't check my notifications on the actual twitter page so I'm at 91 notifications in an hour...
Fun fact,I can see my DMs as well as a bunch of other things while using tweetdeck. So feel free to DM me I will get back to you quickly.
I sure do enjoy using minorities for clout!

I have to resist checking my notifications because I have so many and I like the flex
Yo? 72wpm?
100 notifications! 900 more to go!

Yes replies are on and yes I'm serious.
Just took a fat shit in your pants. B)
Might deactivate permanently. Idk
Story time:

So yesterday someone looked at my phone while I was on twitter and asked me if I was looking at porn. I legit said "yeah wanna watch with me?"

Funniest thing I've said in the last month
Just remember this.

A person could be trans for a while then realize that they were wrong. This does not mean they were looking for attention. Sometimes we believe something and later realize we are wrong. It's normal, it's allowed.

Serious tweet 2.0. have a good day.

@ the dumbest in your friend group. Because I can relate to those people and I need friends so I can be stupid without feeling awful
Alright, you have until the end of my English class to reply. I will follow everyone who replies.

How to be popular on twitter in 6 easy steps

1. Be a protogen
2. Be a horny minor
3. Make a bunch of horny tweets
4. Get suspended
5. Make a new account
6. Repeat
I've said it before. Mass tagging with me in it is a easy way to get muted/blocked.
sometimes.... sometimes.... sometimes I.... nevermind
Heads up, I don't accept everyone. If I barely know you, your request will sit there.
Okay,
@CookiePrivagen
 is my alt account. Have fun with that
I'm going to make a private account again. Very few people will have access to the tweets
The fact #nineten21 is trending higher than #SuicidePreventionDay is concerning.
.@DracoDotWav

You really do look like this
I hate I when people change their name several time in a relatively short amount of time and proceed to get mad with me when I accidentally use the wrong name.

Like bro, you change your name more than I change my bed sheets, you really expect me to be consistent? Jeez.
If I follow you and you change your PFP to the 21 kid I'm unfollowing. Annoy me and I'll block you. This isn't a joke.
The 21 kid isn't funny. Plus its not even the right day. The 9th of October 2021 is 9/10/21.
Normal
Does anyone know who u/[deleted] is on reddit? I see them everywhere but I have no clue who it is!
Chemistry? I'm playing Friday Night Funkin
Honestly. Being called valid does literally nothing for me. It's meaningless when you get called valid every single day by random people who aren't even likely to be your friend. Like instead of calling me valid, have a nice conversation with me instead. That would be better.

Today is judgment day. For Americans.

It's 10/9/21 (DD/MM/YY)

Why is it called a cookie if you bake it...
Why am I called cookie if I'm not a cookie.
Was I baked?

*Tests myself*
REAL!
You'll never find a  in my bio, name or PFP while on twitter.

I might be trans but I really don't need to go around and basically say I'm trans to everyone that sees me.

Also greatly reduces the amount of transphobes I encounter because they automatically assume I'm not trans
I'm so done. I simply cannot.
I literally post random memes and average more likes than if I say something serious.

That's twitter do you
Do you like twitter?

Apparently my account is restricted for 12 hours, but now it's not...?

Why.


Accidental tweet, move along

Totally normal stream overlay, nothing suspicious here

Anyways I'm live for the night, stop by. Imma just promote my streams here until I'm ready to come back

https://twitch.tv/cookietheprotogen…
Nothing good comes out of twitter.

90% of people use their sexuality as a personality. Toxicity is through the roof. Cancel culture is everywhere I look. I'm done, Sky is done.

If you want to find me, start a DM and an automated
message will be sent with a discord server link
Final tweet, likely a thread.

 I'm already so done with twitter and I've been back for a little over 24 hours. This place hasn't and won't ever change.

I refuse to be here until I am ready mentally. I won't be posting anymore, Sky will be staying off twitter.
https://twitch.tv/cookietheprotogen…
Live
Fortunately, it was only a small cut. I told sky to stay off twitter. Unless something important comes up, I'll also stay off twitter. I will still answer DMs, but not post.
Sky is okay.
I'm going to do my best to keep Sky off of twitter, especially now. I'll keep you all updated on how she is,but I can't really say anything else until I get a response. Until then, I will answer whatever questions you have.
No response yet.
I've promised myself since early 2020 to never cut myself again, but with my mind telling me that all this is my fault, and where I was already mentally drained, the thoughts refuse to stop. I'll stay strong though, not for my, but for sky.

I'm also hella tired.
I seriously am starting to get mentally crushed. I'm allowing people to message me. I really need it. This is too much. I can't handle it.
I simply just can't take it. I really can't.
I'm finding it very difficult not having someone to talk to. In literally about to break down crying for the third time tonight.
If you want to, reply with a nice message. I'll privately forward it to sky via discord. Anything helps, but don't troll, I swear of you troll I'm going to flip.
Hesitate to call you out.
Also, I won't be going to sleep tonight just in case she ends up coming back online in the middle of the night. If you want to sleep and are worried about her, I'll deal with everything. Please understand that this is a very serious situation and if I see jokes I will not
d) She has been easily angered lately, not sure why.
e) Her grandmother has been nagging her constantly fr the past few days, she's expressed it was annoying her

I'll keep you updated, and please know I will be keeping her off twitter intentionally because this place is not safe
Here's all I can really tell you about what's going on.
a) Sky lost something today. I have no idea what.
b) Sky has been upset over the fight me, frozen, holo and her had. (Holo/Frozen were against Me and her)
c) She has been purposely avoiding social contact, including with me
I'm going to say this now, if sky is okay and tweets again, I don't want anyone spamming her DMs. Leave this to me. I'm her girlfriend, I was supposed to be there to help, and I wasn't.
Currently, All I know is she's not okay, and not responding to DMs. If you know who I'm talking about. That's ok.
I'm back and not by choice. Don't DM me unless it's necessary. Shit went from 0 - 1,000,000 real quick
Yesterday at 23:58 (EST - 2:30) someone gained access to my account credentials and logged in and reactivated my account.

I'm not back, I changed my password to something I'm going to forget. Thought I'd let you know why my account exists again.

See you around.
Normalize saying I love you to your friends

This command prompt look is just not good. I might make an interface so I can at least have a start.
Slow API smh
Anyways, My tweet manager will be for just myself, so, if I ever finish it, I WON'T be distributing it.
Still waiting for the app name to update...
Hm, might take the API time to update my app name
Updated the app name, aswell as the app! I'm gonna make my own tweet manager! Currently it can only send tweets through command prompt :/

The twist would be someone gets "hit" by one of the bullets, but then they get the gun and would have to face a challenging decision of using it against someone at the risk of getting hit by the previous shot.
I had a dream that could be made into a Black Mirror episode or something. It's about a revolver that when shot, the bullets don't exist at that point in time until all rounds have been shot. An assassin could shoot someone, but they won't get hit till all shots have been made.
Okay, I'm surprised that a lot want to be the actors in it, guests still role play roles, but what I'm most concerned about is how many of you want to be the dead body/bodies.
If you were to be apart of a murder mystery party, what role would you want to play?
I would love to get a big group together and setup and do a murder mystery over a weekend somewhere.

I love good foreshadowing, as long as it's not obvious in what is going to happen later. It could be completely unseen till later or allow accurate prediction with a sense of doubt that is exhilarating when proven right.

So...When I tried to remove a few bots while live on stream, it somehow wiped the 4500+ follows that I had built up for the past 3 years.

If you could or have already been following me prior. I would really appreciate the refollow and spreading the word.

All in all, just saying it's the reason things have been and will be quiet from me for a while. At least until I figure out my mental health situation again, plus doing that alongside moving at an unpredictable time in the near or not so near future.
Been officially off my medications now for a while, since I lost my insurance for then, and it's been a huge drain on me. I forget how hard it was to get myself to do most things before them. I've been reacquainting myself with my anxieties and some.

Taking one day at a time.

Going to be fun!
I had a dream where we try helping someone else fix their dream. We went in, but just ended up making things worse, as usual.
First run through: Cat fur everywhere, big mess.
Second run through: Cat in dinosaur outfit slay innocents as we accidentally gave him a knife.
My mouth is full of stitches, but the surgery wasn't all bad, though the constant pain all of yesterday wasn't pleasant.

I was tearing up at the end for sure. It was a memorable adventure and thank you

 for not just being along for the ride, but making that ride itself for us to experience.
Starting earlier today!
Yet another side project slowly progressing in the background.
More progress on that kobold! Not rushing it so I can be sure everything works for customization and more for VR
Given how my internet has been acting since I've moved here, I'm not sure if I can stream at all. I've tried several various stream setups that somewhat help, but it can't fix the core issue which is my wonky upload.

I'm not sure I can handle VRChat rigging anymore, every update breaks something and is a pain to fix, let alone the other persistent issues. I'll probably need to find someone else to do the rigging for me, if not just the importing/unity config for me.

Here's a condensed process video for the head fur portion of the groom if anyone is interested. #xgen #maya #furry
I'm so jazzed with how
@VinceWuff
 has turned out. Heckin' handsome wolf.
It's not very controllable besides the minimal rewinding I can do, but will become too distorted or move on to the next thing if I linger too long.
It's absolutely random from a blue fire-headed trapezist that propels herself with green fire breath to a handheld meat grinder where the cogs are made out of grapefruit with a poppy minimalistic background. Is that weird?
There's something I've been pondering. After a moment of closing my eyes for the night, I'm taken away by somewhat distorted, but vivid visual images/animations in my head...
Finally moved into a new place after a week of waiting! Still a lot of unpacking to accomplish, but things will hopefully settle down soon here.
OMG I'm dying of laughter!
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Just a reminder to everyone that DnD tomorrow will start 3 hours earlier than normal at 12PM PST

I’ve been fiddling a bit with

I’m unsure yet how much I’ll be around online, but if you see this brightly coloured doggo on VRChat, it’s me!

Were there any birds in Zootopia? I can't remember any.
Last night I tried to change things up by adding more expression and character to my sculpts, besides the bird. Tried my hands at a robin, a malevolent cheetah, and a nerdy otter!
Guess who’s turning 25 next month on the 11th:) in case anyone is interested, I’d love some more artwork of my boy!:) doesn’t need to be anything crazy either! I’m starting to collect more work for him

TRELL NO WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU
Final sculpt was a rat! Finally a species I've actually done in the past at least a little bit. Given the simpler forms, thought it would be a good practice run to play with characterization mixed in on top of the sculpt. #SpeedSculpt
Fourth sculpt we made a northern crested newt! I didn't even knew these guys existed! It had a lot of unique forms that I wasn't familiar with, so I didn't have the speed to capture the complexity of these spiny bois. #SpeedSculpt
Third sculpt we made a donkey! Not sure I emphasized the donkey features to pull away from a horse, but I still enjoy the facial forms that came out of it. #SpeedSculpt
Second sculpt we made a leopard gecko. Because of that reference, I couldn't resist adding in a tongue to make him a blepping boi. #SpeedSculpt
Speed Sculpt Thursday was a lot of fun last night on stream! We started off with this opossum. Didn't have a lot of time or familiarity with the body to get a proper form, but still kind of like him. Just needs teeth and he'll be a real screaming boi. #SpeedSculpt

I'm going to setup a night to do a speed sculpt at least once a week and stream it. Over the course of the year, hopefully we'll see an improvement in speed and style.
Thank you
@Caribrewery
 for this absolutely incredible piece!!! You went above and beyond any of my wildest expectations  Thanks for all your effort!
It's crazy interesting to see the fabric patterns come to life. I feel this has a lot more potential than just model work.

Sculpt  Face Map

@Caribrewery
 found you and coffee
Experimenting with new tricks to rig furry snouts in Live2D. It's been a long while since my last attempt.
I've finally crawled my way back out of the woods and am back from CFT! Though I'm still going to be traveling around for a couple days before settled back home.
First Blender model. Getting the hang of modelling now! #b3d
I'll be at CFT tomorrow afternoon, once there I'll have little to no reception, so I will be offline and unreachable for the most part on everything for about 5 days.
Though not very "speedy", here's the result of last night's speed sculpt stream!
The process isn't first come first serve, so I feel it would be nice to allow people to get all their information put into my system whenever. With them being able to edit, it gives people time to think over everything over time.
Question is, how can I set it up so I know who is wanting a chance in a queue opening or not? Or many I can leave it as a grab bag and whenever I have a spot, grab a couple and contact them to see if they want in, else grab another.
Alright, so I'm switching my submission process to docs so you can save responses easily. That way you only need to submit once and won't need to repeat information. You can also edit it whenever.
I heckin did it, I re-textured

 for the incredible opportunity! This clip is just a taste. For the full 3 minute video visit: https://vimeo.com/349802228

So apparently it's pretty easy to get a rigged model into Clip Studio to use within Clip Paint and posable.

Coloring this was so much fun and I feel so cute now!
Alright, I'm in the process of getting myself out of this rut I've been in.
This is a #WIP, but still we wanted to show you how we test game mechanics and how they look while under development.

Let us know with a  or  if you think this hunting skill is looking good so far!

#screenshotsaturday #gamedev #indiedev #gamedevelopment #Endling #UE4
BouModels has always sounded a bit off to me, so I've officially changed everything over to Caribrewery instead as it will be the name I register my business under.
This is surprisingly relaxing and fun! Still getting the base forms in, but no rush!
What have I gotten myself into
There was this really amazing environmental 3D artist I met at BLFC. I had their business card, but lost it before I got home. If you know who, let me know! I wanna find them!
@BouModels Drew your Caribou!
I drew a caribou for motivation, and now he’s here to motivate you!
Had a fantastic time at BLFC and meet so many amazing folk! Now I'm ready to get back on top of my FaceRig work and more!
BLFC Charity Auction at 5:00PM today! This boy will be up for bidding, come join the fun!
Just added the
@BLFC_Bear
 barbarian sculpture to the

 art gallery for show before the charity auction on Sunday! Be sure to check him out! #BLFC2019
I got a couple good shots! I'll get more tomorrow of
@BLFC_Bear
 model for BLFC charity auction!
Made it to BLFC!
On my way to BLFC!
This bear is going to be done at the very last minute. I'll take a couple good photos before I pass it on to the charity auction.
I keep messing things up on this bear x.x I think he'll be good, but his base, not so much.
Come find me at BLFC! #BLFC2019
Minor crisis, the model fell slightly while drying, not all the way thankfully. There's a scrape I need to clean up and some. Going to cut the stream short to announcements tonight in order to focus on it.
Painted a set of the minis designed by
@JoshuaMK2
 for
@BiggestLittleFC
 (Segal Rogue not pictured) with a little chest/dice box to take them home in!  These will be available at the Charity Auction!
#BLFC2019
Gluing magnets into the foot pedestals for the bear
I put too much paint on the back of the sculpt, but it's extremely malleable and I'm forming it with my tools to add shape. This makes me really want to attempt working with physical clay.

Attached most of the model tonight! Just need to clean him up and finish putting him together!
All major pieces have a coat of paint on them and tonight I'll be assembling the bar-bear-ian fully on stream!
Assembling has begun! Though still another coat and touchups need to be done after he's mostly put together.
The cloak printed so beautifully
Arms and hands printed, took about 9 hours. Legs are now printing and those are estimated to take 19 hours.
Now I just need to sand it and do a paint/assembly test
The test leg print has finished. I like the size it came out as, though some issues have been observed. Mainly some sections printed too think for the material to withstand, but other than that, things look good.
Thank you so much for the massive raid
@Dodg3rr
 was my first one of over 5 and everyone that followed! Ended up sending the fun over to @BouModels , absolutely love watching people art, especially 3D modeling while explaining what they are doing. Have a great night everyone!
I found Caribooze.
Here's a sneak peek at the WIP of the barbarian sculpture I'll be 3D printing and auctioning off at
@BiggestLittleFC
 charity auction. #BLFC2019
Here it is! My beetle pattern for $5 patreon patrons this month. What do you think?
Finally got my @BouModels coloring done! I'm looking pretty snazzy now I must say!
I might start adding RizomUV to my workflow as it is capable of UV symmetry editing and gets the result quickly for what I'm looking for. I'm just very wary of adding yet another program to my list that I have to keep transferring my model to.

Alrighty, it’s 3am, I’m going to get some rest, see ya every once in a while! :D
I’ll be around occasionally to post fox photos, or say hello, maybe we can even meet at a convention one day, or see ya around San Diego, me and my fiancé love giving hugs! :D
Also like, I’ve got my life I’m focusing on, getting a house and car soon, about to get married in the near future, I don’t really have time for this type of environment, especially as I start my entry back into the civilian world, that is already mighty stressful D:
You become the people you are surrounded with, and I’m realizing some of the people I’ve been around with, who I thought were cool, are actually pretty trashy and manipulative people, and I don’t think it’s crazy to say I don’t wanna be surrounded by people like that. D:
I’m gonna like be around…sorta?
I been seeing people’s true colours lately, and quite frankly I don’t really approve of the audience that is the twitter furry community.

Love and support is earned naturally throughout the course of time and experiences.

Respect is earned on a mutual basis, formed from a healthy bond between trustworthy friends, and a mutual understanding of having each others backs.

(My own experiences at least)
It’s fascinating.
I get hate for receiving the amount of love and support I get from people.

But who are you to decide who is worthy of getting love and support?

Aren’t we all warranted to have love and support?

I’d like to think so, maybe the world could be a better place.
I have da memes for war :D

Hey, your account might be 18+ only, (cool) and it’s good that you block minors who interact or follow your account, prevent them from seeing your content.

What ya doin down there?
Tell me I am wrong.

People befriend others for gain
-better standing with popular folks
-better chances at recognition
-better chances at getting noticed

Why can’t people just be people instead of numbers?
People spend more time trying to get popular and big in the fandom, then they do actually meeting people, and building lasting friendships with folks.
Stop listening to everyone about everything and do what makes you happy
Furry Fandom Advice:

Don’t try to reason or rationalize with shitty people, focus on you and the people who aren’t shitty to you.

Leave the shitty people behind and move on from them, as they will only hold you back from your future goals, and your personal progression.
I like to post fox pictures I find/that are sent to me, they make me smile, and I hope that maybe they can make others smile too :D

Hey,
You don’t HAVE to go through transition in order to be a valid trans person, go at your own pace, and whatever you feel comfortable with.

Early morning videogames with Black Eyed Peas and Billie Eilish is such a vibe man! :D

I am not joking.

Me and my boyfriend ordered matching rings, and we paid to engrave them with the text, "Gay homo gay" on them.

Chances are,
There is someone or a group of people screenshotting your posts, and either in a private account or group chat, making fun of you, and talking trash about you.

This speaks volumes though as they fail to do it in front of you or on a public account.

Heya, i found a really neat and true fact,

Even if 99% of the Earth’s population found you to be unattractive, there would still be a total of 76 million people who would still find you to be attractive.

I love you all, remember you are cared for and have value :D
Hey. You there. Yeah, you! You're important, and you matter, okay? Don't forget it!
Hewwo internet friends :D

Little check up from the Squeaky fox!

I hope you are all doing well, and having a lovely day!

I love you all (no homo...unless) and I hope you are staying safe :D
Gotten a lot of DM's asking if I am ok.
I am fine, just laying low, and on high alert rn for any unusual activity, I started up the investigation through NCIS to catch the bastard who tried scamming me.

Gonna go pop some popcorn and watch the justice unfold. :D
Sorry if I am slow with messages, I got a hell of a lot of them, and I am currently networking with like 4 people rn, trynna take care of business.

Love yall, sorry for the delay
Everything has been reset, 2FA has been added where it aint, fuck the old steam account, idgaf about it barely any games there anyway, no loss of money or other, so that's all that matters.
Alrighty, I can start to relax, I got the Naval Crime Investigation Service involved justice will be achieved, all my accounts, passwords, etc are in full battlestations mode rn.

We vibin big dawg.
Hey, since my Steam account was stolen and subsequently deleted from me, I made a new one if you wanna add me as a friend on my new one.

Profile Name is:
Tha Real Squeaky Fox
No money stolen, all account info changed, passwords and all, gonna file a NCIS report to varify my personal ID and social wasn't stolen in the very off chance it was.

Hoping for the best.
DON'T. TRUST. ANYONE. EVER.
I had no idea their account was hacked and I thought it was a sincerely concerned friend, please if you get any messages like this, DO NOT FALL FOR IT

Part 2
Please keep in mind I found out the account was hacked just a few moments ago, but this is how it all started
If you had me on steam my account is completely gone, it was taken and I have no idea what is going on with it, chances are I will have to make a new one after I get new info.
I think my identity might have been stolen or compromised, I am freaking out I have no idea what to do.
My Steam account got hacked, and I almost got scammed out of $250 via bitcoin.
passed the theory for driving
Feeling really good and chill rn!
I hope y’all are doing well and staying safe, love you all /p

I named my sona Squeaky because I am genuinely squeaky irl when I get really happy, excited or nervous, I start uncontrollably squeaking.
What inspired the name of your fursona?
Sup yall?
I will be right back, I love you all, you all mean a lot to me
Finished my next painting, this one is of

Update: checked out of the hospital, was able to make him smile, he scared me to death, but I’m glad he is in a better headspace, didn’t sleep too well last night, he is a good friend, one of my closest.

Check up on your friends, remind them you care about them.
I’m sorry for not being active, just focusing on irl stuff, it’s what matters, not this twitter crap.
Please take a moment out of your day to remind your friends and loved ones that they matter, let them know that you care and don’t forget to share the good times with them.
Had a traumatic night tonight, one of my closest irl friends tried committing suicide tonight, I managed to get there in time, and the authorities were not too far behind me.

Got him in the hospital, getting his vitals, bloodwork, etc the whole sha-bang.

I am grateful for him.
I love you all, be safe please.

【 Aki daily Life 】#6 - Cake

I really fucking wanna go through transition, you don’t know how dysphoric I’ve been.
If you think I am invalid, go and fuck yourself.
Ay, people are fuckin brain dead, so I dug out my paperwork that the military gave me when I was pursuing gender transition,

The highlighted part is why I took a temporary pause for my preexisting mental health conditions.
It’s not fuckin easy tho
I really hope I can correct these things so I can begin with what I want to do
I’ve been publicly at this shit for about a year now coming this December
I really wish I could’ve been able to do transition back in august…
I really wanna go on HRT.
To be clear I am no saint, I have done the “irl vs sona” stuff before, but like when this kinda shit is happening every day or every other day, that’s past the line yo.
Y’all know mfs who do this shit often and y’all still let this continue?
Then these are the same people who claim that people are unoriginal, yet they let shit like this slide.

Pathetic.
Btw, if this post offends you, stay mad bitch.
I may not be the most appealing individual, however you get me as me, I don’t have any masks to hide behind, what you see is what you get, I am truthful, forward and loyal, and I haven’t a single regret about who I am and how far I’ve come.
No, seriously.
I’m like, ready to fight a war.

Imma clown on this shit.

Twitter furry clout chaser starter pack:
I post this because I’ve had people ask multiple times.
I apologize if I seem short tempered or more direct, I got some bad irl news lately medically speaking that I don’t feel comfortable talking about, and in turn it’s effecting my mood a little.

So. I’m sorry.
Little tip from personal experience.

If you’re going to take a break from social media, just do it, people don’t care, and in fact you will find that a lot of times they will become annoyed with you for making posts like that.

It’s a fucked up place, but its the place we got.
Look, I’m not a good influence here, but I gotta say, when you stop caring about everything, things feel easier to manage.
I sacrifice mortal souls to the blood god.

I’d also say that off platform furry community is vastly better than what you get here on furry twitter, try other platforms :D

If you have a different opinion, fuck you.

Pat it’s head a few times?
Twitter rhymes with shitter.

Coincidence?!
I THINK NOT!
…wait…
Good morning Fried Chicken, I am going to get me some Twitter. :)
I need a moment
I am uninformed of all of this and only see surface level stuff so far, I just don’t understand why people are excluding trans people like this, it’s kind of fucked up if you ask me D:
Why do people take the T off of LGBTQ+?

What did trans people do wrong to deserve this kind of treatment?
I dress like this often when I am alone…which is often

Breathing in oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide.
Have had the question brought up to me a lot.
To be clear, we are not dating, I just wanted to get something nice for a close friend.

I am single, and not ready to date right now, thank you.

Bored and need to give myself something to do.
Please provide your fursona reference sheet if you want to be drawn.

Examples of my work are as follows:
My art 5 months ago vs today.

When I am happy, they say I am being “uwu cutesy”.
When I am upset or hurt, they say I are being an attention whore.

Where is the middle ground?
Can I like not live my life and have emotions?

They got that algorithm to follow

I think we should replace the term popufur with Robot.

Because we relate popufurs as having the same no personality trait, lack of creativity, and the same cookie cutter behavior.

These are all things that are traits best described as a robot.

Robots > Popufur.
The crime of too much cringe xD

Didn’t even realize how close I am to 2k, I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me a bit anxious knowing there is an audience of people watching me and what I post.

I just hope that I am good enough for y’all, for whatever it is you’re looking for

I really don’t deserve y’all.

Morning yall :)
Fuzzbutts, this is the last time I'll have to do this, but because I changed jobs, this month I have to pay for my antidepressants and meds without insurance. If any of you can help me out in any way, I'll love you forever. Please hit me up on DM if you do
Goodnight! :D
Today’s been a really good day, like the past week has been really really good, things are taking a positive direction for both myself and for the overall wellness of the day.

I hope you all are doing well, and thanks for being a part of my day today!
Goodnight!

#FursuitFriday
My Sona + My Soda :3
It’s crazy how fast time flies, and that it’s already been a year since my first Twitch Con.

It’s a huge bummer 2020’s events lead to the cancellation of it, but that just means there’ll be more hype for the next.

Can’t wait to see everyone in person that I’ve met this year
WHY DIDNT YOU GUYS TELL ME???
POV: robbed by a small ferret with a gun
everyone listen. this is important.

When you have to explain to people you offended "I was just joking" - it probably wasn't a funny joke.
never let a weasel fly a plane


I hate cancelling streams, but I think I'm going to take the night off to rest my poor vocal cords from last nights Among Us session! So much yelling, this Dingo needs to heal up!
AMONG US RUINS FRIENDSHIPS

Hey guys. Please don't bash streamers because they're not raiding who you want them to raid. I think I speak for all of us when I say it makes us not even want to do it at all... It hurts when you try to spread some love and people get mad because it wasn't their friend. :/

So I managed to cut my drinking down to one night a week. From this moment forward, I'm going to attempt to be 100% sober. No more drinking, not even a sip. It's going to be hard, but I think... I think I've got this. I wanna post updates. Love y'all.
Ever want to just, get something off your chest? Emotions running high? Scream it at the top of your lungs? But maybe it's not a good idea..? Worst feeling.

@shreddyfox
 to make a paintover of a selfie I’ve been wanting for a while. And I’m just gushing. It’s... me.

Thank you so much again Shreddy! I’ll have to make you something someday!
Group species pics!

Images taken moments before disaster...
Had a blast hosting all these adorable wahs last night! Thank you all for coming!
Buying all the wah things and browsing the artist alley has really inspired to be creative again. Also getting lots of ideas for my fursuit!
normies should just give in and pick a fursona already
Chilling in the lobby playing with my camera settings. If you’re here, come say hi!
With my suitcase and camera gear might I add!

I’m exhausted.
My flight departed at 5, but the shuttle from my parking spot didn’t leave till 4:30. So I ran 5 miles to the airport and just barely made it!

Idk if I’m a badass or a dumbass for running through traffic and mud at 3 in the morning lol.
Fly out tomorrow morning and I’m super nervous but excited. I don’t know what I signed up for, but I know MFF is gonna be wild!

떠돌이상인 러프
Back from the barber. Almost ready for Chicago!
I’m not sure what happened this weekend, but I feel okay now. Just taking a deep breath and moving forward. And I’m excited for the future.

Can’t believe MFF is in 2 days! Hope to see some of you there!
danger wah

HOLY CRAP PLS
Thanks to those who reached out to me this weekend. I’m fine. Just need to refocus and work on the things that make me happy like my hobbies. But I’m so glad I have wonderful people like you to talk to.
The furry cabal is real and only everyone has recently noticed, it’s too late.

Struggling tonight. Just have had too much to think and cry about this year. Yeah, I made it. I chose to survive. But I often wonder why I tried so hard to be where I’m at rn. Just tired. And don’t think I have much more to give. I’ll have to let go of some things soon.
Painting the little dragon who wanted some bread...
Watching Arcane with my friend who came down for the break. It’s soooo good! I hope Riot makes more series like this.

Drunk and full of apple pie. I thought  some tarragon would taste good in and it was divine! Roommate gave it a 9.5/10. Thanksgiving dinner was so good this year. Wish you could have come.
Happy Thanksgiving! Love you guys!
Typical furry convo
Lol and better than cats too!
In the oven! Bwisket! :3
Lol they have more hp than a person. Now imagine an army of them.

What’s your species’ stats?
Kill me, I just tackled this line integral assignment and I finally am lost this semester. I am clueless and about to cry.
Got everything to start cooking tomorrow. See you there?
I won’t have my partial done by MFF, but hopefully soon. I just get both excited and sad seeing the orange fur in the box just waiting to come to life.
So glad I actually got my normal two day weekend. I needed to rest.
Seeing people at MFF irl for the first time. I’m gonna be the shortest one there lol.
Pizza and beer kinda night. I earned it.

Had dinner with family from out of town. They don’t know I’m gay.

Was talking and my aunt said “It’s good you’re working hard now and going to school, because it gets harder with a girlfriend or boyfriend…”

I nodded and didn’t say anything. But it felt nice.

Most frustrating thing about learning guitar is being a musician in band for 11 years and not being able to fix mistakes or play musically because I just don’t have the physical ability to do so.

Also the fretboard is hard to learn. Don’t know what notes I’m playing.
Okay so how bad can energy drinks be? I had a monster, and I went from feeling shitty to just normal, but my mood improved 500%. Def something for rough days.

I just wanted to say a few this to settle the score once and for all. He deserves all the peace and support in the world as he goes through this troubled time.
So I had a long candid talk with my ex. I want everyone to know that he apologized and recognized the things he  did to me. And I forgave him.

It was easy for me to do. He's just human. And though I may never reconcile the things that were done to me, I can say I gained an ally
Got an apology yesterday. It was everything I needed to hear. And I wasn’t ready.

Want to say I’m glad for it but it was so much easier to hate you. And now I can’t.

And the fact still remains that I fell in love with a lie.

Not okay today.

There is one imposter among us
It discounts everything we ever did together. And had my friend not disclosed the truth to me and given me the closure I had sought for months, his admission would have really hurt me.

Also rich that he thought he can say that because I’m not looking.
I know I said I wouldn’t. Even told my ex that I would stay out of this fight. But I did not agree to be silent so he could spout nonsense.

I believe him when he says this is his first heartbreak. But he does not get to say that so he can be pitied. Not at my expense.
I apologize for today. It is unlike me to come out publicly and talk about personal matters. I don’t want the attention, just to move on. But my friend couldn’t for a month, and I wanted to stand with him as he goes through this. He took it very hard today.
Sometimes as Admiral, the best thing you can do is suit up, hop in your experimental F8X, and show the rest of the Squadron a little thing or two about combat flying.

Feel pretty damn good today, despite drinking half a bottle if tum last night lol. Gonna work hard one more night and finish up this week strong.
So learn from this. Grow. Be a better man, or don’t and stay single. Because every boy deserves your fucking best.

You’re a predator. You go after people without any regard for how they feel. But maybe now you know just how much it hurts.

Hurts like a bitch, doesn’t it?
and said those things. You were worried about self-destructing, about losing the love and attention of the boy you were after even while you and I dated. Perhaps you should have thought of that as you were breaking his heart. And mine.
it’s about what you get to give. But any time you never get your way, you get bent out of shape and lashed out.

All we ever wanted to do was make you happy. And we went out of the way to do so. And it seemed none of it really mattered to you. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have done
What you fail to understand, wolf, and what you’re starting to see is that you can’t treat people like you do. Like you treated your last two relationships. Love is not transactional. It’s not a business. Sometimes you give more than you receive. But it’s not about what you get,
like so many others have done to me in the past.

You broke me, made me think I wasn’t enough. Wasn’t enough. That phrase has been my biggest insecurity my whole life. And I thought you’d be different.
It’s hard to see you self-destruct this way, because I wanted you to be happy. Even after waiting a week in silence for you to break up with me, I didn’t fight back, because I wanted you to find the person you really wanted. I just didn’t think you’d ghost me and throw me away
What were those 4 months then? Why did you speak to me out of the blue and played with my heart when you could have told me the truth, wolf? Was it to just get into my pants? I bet it’s because I gave you what you like most: power, control, and endless attention to feed your ego.
You know what sucks, even to this day? I’m over my ex, but I’ve been keeping up with my friend who dated him. He never loved me. He said as much, when he says he’s dealing with his first heartbreak right now. After I had given him the best parts of me, including my heart.
Ever yawn so hard your eyes tear up? That’s me, all this week.
Wth?! Tillamook ice cream has got to be the best ice cream I have ever had! Why hasn’t anyone told me about it before?
I hate to get caught up in drama. But when your friends, are being hurt and manipulated, you can’t stay silent.
I’ve been debating to open up about my last relationship, but it’s beneath me. But he continues to harass his last ex and won’t admit his wrongdoings. Refuses to apologize. And he wonders why he’s being ignored and canceled.

This sums up my thoughts. Well said. Thank you.
My snake friend got me addicted to Halo. Now I get to enjoy the childhood I missed out on on Xbox. Just in before Infinite!
Unfortunately, it looks like I’m rooming alone for Stratosfur.

It’s okay though! Life happens.
Sweet tea seems to last only a few sips. Need a gallon jug with me next time

I just, don’t want to hate my art anymore.
I’m rededicating myself to this starting tomorrow. Thank you for your patience.
Just know I’m working hard to keep my word, and to put out art that I can be proud of. I want to be a real artist in this fandom. I don’t want glaring issues in my work, especially when there’s thousands of people who can do it better and faster.
Been working on stickers, but honestly, I haven’t liked the work I’ve been doing. I think I need to overhaul my style.

I know lot’s of you have been waiting. I just feel like I need to do better than what I have been. Style hasn’t changed in years, and I have tons of mistakes.

if you are hyper-anxious and predisposed to emotionally spiraling out of control then your fursona is a red panda. this is a well understood fact.
I have been trying to rest since my last class ended. I still try to wake up at 7 in the morning to exercise, but fall back asleep till 11.

I wonder if there’s something wrong with me. This fatigue feels unusual. Doesn’t go away no matter how much I sleep.
Here's a result of those torso studies I did yesterday - already some improvement! I'm going to hold off on finishing the legs until I can do studies of those too.
What if, like, art or something?
“Don’t cross an ocean for someone who won’t cross a puddle for you.”

I’ve heard this quote many times. They say in the end to do it still. Go the extra mile for people, even when they don’t deserve it.

It’s true. But don’t let other’s shortcomings bring you down. Not worth it.
"Better to fight and fall than to live without hope."

All this drama this whole week man. It’s over and done with, and I’m just ready to move on and live my life.

Gonna really knock back some drinks this weekend though.
Lot’s of you don’t know what’s been going on in my life. I try to keep negative stuff off my account. But been getting love and support from amazing people I’m glad to call friends.

Fuck statics. I’m done. I aced the damn test. Let me sleep now.

Arrived at 1:30 this morning to visit family. My dad got out of bed just to see me and hug me. And I fucking cried.

He will never know the pain I went through these last 6 months. But he’s still here for me. And it feels so good just to cry on someone’s shoulder.
Baked a cake for my coworker who’s leaving today. She’s been with me at that job since the beginning. Gonna miss her. I hope she likes it.
I've done this.

Well, I finished my last lesson of Mandarin 1 audio lessons! I can say I’m confident that I could survive with basic stuff in China. But it will be a LONG time before I can speak fluently.

Who are these fursuiters spotted in an Uber commercial?
So true. And the whole kids thing. They should wait for my sister lol. Hope I never have to come out to them too.
Tried to get more of the yellow color to show, but this is my spicy turmeric latte! Extra foamy!
We share apples.
8 min mile.

Alright. It’s time to kick some ass. Gonna get tons of work done.
I am so fortunate to have such wonderful friends to talk to. Getting on discord and acting like a dumb wah while having some serious talks was really good for my heart tonight.

I want you all to know, you are loved by this wah.
don't you HATE when this happens to you?
Picture surfaced from years ago when I was a barista. Once a pandumbass, always a pandumbass.
What if, like, your fursuit paws had a small stylus as a claw so you could still use your phone with it on?
Just echoes a lot of thoughts I’ve had and still think about. Think I need to digest it some more, but I feel... happy.
Well another 2 coworkers quit, so I’ll be having to pick up the slack for a while. And have to train 2 new folks. Not fun.
*lets you out*
Now that everybody’s calmed down, how about we go do something fun? Get something to eat maybe? :3 (last sketch… for now)
I’m from West Texas. While I don’t miss living in the desert, nothing compares to the insane storms we had in the early summer. This pic is stunning!
I was gonna wait until next month to share, but Savaj is so freakin fast at what he does! And I cannot understate how incredibly pleased I am with this piece! The ocean is beautiful. Almost resembles a memory.

Anyways, be proud of who you are. Be YOU.
I am a wahnderer.

I don’t know what it really means to be gay. Only know I’ve been searching for something and haven’t found it yet. And while my experience with sexuality hasn’t been the happiest, I know it won’t stay that way.

I’m moving on to new horizons.

Since we’re all digital artists now, I wanted to share some of my favorite techniques that I apply to my illustrations. These were done in Procreate, but I’ve added keywords so you can find if they’re applicable in your favorite art program, but I know they work in CSP & PS. (1/)
Feeling a little extra. Having a meeting at the lab and felt pretty gay this morning. I love dressing up, but
@ShepKyred
 does it so much better!
Me when I tell myself I'll branch off and try something new.
After drawing so many faces recently, I need to really practice eyes, among other things. After this queue, I’m going to just take time to refine techniques and learn how to paint. Also work on personal projects for pride month.

a few words on the "popufur graph" I made
Love my summer walks outside the lab
Anxious from lack of sleep. But then, too anxious to sleep.
Hidden scenes
The color change is so jarring. I was staring at my phone this morning so confused
Finally reconciled with a very important person. The dark cloud that’s been looming over my head is finally gone. I’m so happy, I’m crying at work.

I’m going to finally be okay.
Shaved 2 minutes off my two mile run today. And lost another pound!
I’m ready for a fresh start.

thank you so much for this commission !!
Nausea and anxiety finally calmed down. Maybe I’ll be able to sleep tonight and be ready for my final tomorrow.
Can’t sleep at all tonight, so decided to finish registering for summer school.

Finally got the answers I needed though regarding a friend. I just can’t believe how embarrassing I can be with people sometimes.

Well, lesson learned.
Just booked my stay at the Stratosfur convention here in less than 100 days! I’m excited for my first con!

Update: So I’m still working on stickers. Thank you for being patient. I just had a lot of stuff irl happen with school and exams. I plan on getting a lot finished this weekend though, so bear with me.
Just want to see what life is about and stop spending weekends alone at home.
I think it’s time for me to grow and stop wishing things would happen. I need to make them happen. Gonna budget and start investing in myself. Go out and do all the things I want to do on my list and visit friends. My life before covid was quarantine and that still hasn’t changed
Dust Devils
Twitter crop is dead, post red pandas
Little experiment with a friend's Fursona.
I think this point in my art ability, I hate that I have to compromise because of time. There are clear issues with some things, but I have to move on or it won’t get finished.
Downloaded a sergal base and played with it on my phone during break at work. Imma call him Rigel! If I find time someday to actually draw him, I will. I like how he looks so far.
I don’t practice enough birds or expressions, so here we are
Merp! Taking over the galaxy as a Sergal empire. I triiiiied to pick civics and traits that were close to the lore, but it was hard, and honestly could be totally wrong . Loving this playthrough and new dlc tho.

Thanks to everyone for being there and supporting me. I love scrolling through twitter and interacting with you all. The fandom is part of my life now. I just want to make art and put a smile on your faces everyday.
Now that you've had a disclaimer, behold her drawing of Shortcake! The moment she gets a Twitter where I can connect people to her, I'll share it. She totally needs Furry art commissions!!!!

UPDATE: I have 8 more stickers to sell if you want them! Message me if you’re interested!

I was drawing in my car, and I think another lab technician saw the refection of my ipad on my window. I was drawing for a solid 5 minutes before I noticed.

Well the YCH was a flop, but it was also because I forgot to add the tags.

Well how about stickers? Would you accept those to help out my friend? Tryna see where I can set up shop in the art community.
Wah sona problems: Do I give myself white eyebrows, or normal ones with white spots on them?
Let me just say, I know that this is borderline NSFW or inappropriate. I intend to make more stuff in the future for comms. But for now, I’d take even like $5 and still do it for you. It’s for a good cause.
Okay! Listen up! I have a friend in need who’s fallen on some hard times. I’m doing a YCH of my latest art. Thinking I can color it too! Comment with your ref sheet and name. I’ll message you later with the art and a link to a paypal. Donate what you think is appropriate!

I hate being demi. I could have had someone already if I could be emotionally attracted to anyone.
Do any of you do VR Chat dates? Idk. The thought of lying on the couch and cuddling somebody, even virtually, seems nice. A nice compromise when distance is a problem.
One day I’ll get to do Fursuit Friday...
Well let’s see. Want me to be your smol wah or your tol boi?
Well, going back home today. I had a lot of fun and got to finally relax for once. But I’m ready to get back into the swing of things. I still have a few days before I get back so imma make some art. Was a gorgeous stay!
BEEP BEEP! IMMA KANGAROO BETCHES!!
Mutuals, have you ever wanted to chat sometime? I feel like I would reach out, if I didn’t feel like I was bothering you. Been wanting to be more social, and I have been chatting up some peeps this week.
Being gay is easy! Just a matter of “give” and “take!”
Alright. AD! It’s happening! Gonna make it this weekend I swear it!

Tbh though, it’s mostly to be a good wah and lurk among NSFW feeds. But, maybe I can be convinced to show some skin...
Love camping, but the smoke got in my eyes and nose and gave me a sneezing fit.
Furries are actually generally some of the most wholesome people I’ve met.
Used to eat push pops as a kid and now I'm a furry.... Huh...
S’more
Gained some perspective on the break so far. Just forgot about living life and being alive these last few months. I’m just ready to work on myself again and be the person that’s always been there on the inside.

if this isnt me then i don't know what is

I learned a hard lesson today, to not mention the forbidden word related to images that belong to businesses.
I want to redraw the Howlr logo
Welll...have you tried turning it off and on again?


Vacay time.
Found some old songs I wrote for orchestra, and now I’m reinspired to write again. I wish I didn’t have so many hobbies though!
I made roasted pumpkin seeds with an “asian” flair (soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, etc), and it came put suuuuuper tasty. Gotta write this down!
Hours into the first day of vacation, and they still haven't gotten dressed for the day. Can't waste a good view!

Would you go on a gay spa day with me and get facials? Or is that too gay for some of yall?
Feeling great this morning. Spent the weekend getting my life back in order. Back to the grindstone!
Sometimes I wish I had an agreement with someone. Beyond sex and relationships. Just be like “I’ll be physically and emotionally here for you, if you’d do the same. I’ll always be here if you need me.”
I think the hardest thing about being single again is that I’m no longer needed. Not even among friends or family. I don’t really have anything unique to offer that they can’t find in someone else.

Since many have been asking, here's a little tip/reminder on how to handle your overlays~
work-from-home life
Furry DnD kicks off tomorrow. I’m anxious but excited. Hope I can knock it out of the park and bring the joy of the game to new players!
my friend want me to draw this scooby expression
Listen to me: you are WORTH it.

Know your worth. If anything, you’re worth it to me.
I need a vacation so badly
Okay damn. I owe lots of hugs...
You are all getting fursuit hugs once I get mine

Hopefully soon!
Had a good day today now that my test is over. Have a few days to relax from school. Time to draw again.

Thanks to everyone who sent me their playlists! I’ll listen to it while I work.
Fun fact: I was almost a badger instead of a wah, making me a dad-ger instead of a pandad. Drew this years ago
Need new things to listen to. I’d love to hear your spotify playlists!
...just a supportive husband/boyfriend!
Mornin
Got a fresh new haircut. Feeling fresh!
yeah
i’m dying
Okay. Gonna start messing with VR chat soon. Need to play for ten hours anyway to upload my own model. Really excited!
Think Imma redo it, but it was funny regardless
I am a pandumbass, doing dumbass things
So uh...
@0ddj0b
 and I were sitting down for breakfast when this lady comes over asking if we were the group she’s supposed to meet, and if I was the son.

Turns out she’s adopting a kid, and the actual kid and chaperone sat down at the table next to us...

>___>;;;
Goals

Boy I'm glad winter is over!
I just found the artist who inspired my style of art and kinda pulled me into the fandom with his awesome art. It’s really surreal because another friend said my style looks like his! I’d say I have a ways to go, but it’s crazy finally able to message him!
Gonna be a great weekend. Also a hella cute guy in line in front of me...
I’m going to paint a classic yiff of myself sitting on a throne with a crown, but with a bunch of male angelic foxes around me
Just a thanks to all my friends for taking the time to reach out and talk. I needed to get my head out of my ass the last few nights. Just know I’m always here for you if you need me
Nintendo needs to release the next Metroid game.
Justin Bieber’s “Lonely,” but replace “lonely” with “horny.”

I cook yummy food, and I can make art. I’ll talk your head off, and listen to your problems. Make the stress go away with a massage.
Anyone want me to be their wah? I’m free Sundays and Mondays.
Read some interesting articles on e-waste and electronic recycling. Wonder what it would take to start a business?
I’m really looking to increase my presence online, just try to be more social even with how busy I am. But that includes making higher quality posts and art. Was trying to prepare for comms, but I’ve been swamped with stuff irl.

I get calculus. I even like it. But I absolutely hate the math problems I get assigned that use the dumbest fucking numbers to the point where each problem takes 20 minutes and I have numbers in the thousands that don’t reduce. I am going to have an aneurysm tonight.
Geez the fur! HOW?
Do you artists do art full time? Cuz there’s like no way I can make art this month lol. Not with 10 hour work days and school.

Man I’m gonna work hard to ensure that I enjoy my 30s

How it all started

If you are going to take a chance, might as well go all in

https://youtu.be/XBMQ-H-qUVk

Found this awesome hand tutorial. Think I’ll try it after work today if I still have the energy.
I interact with furries more than I do with people irl. You guys are more my crowd.
Definitely not a moo-rning person!

Fun full-body commission for Kernin! (on FA) Really enjoyed drawing this sleepy boy!
Someone give me the gay!
Getting my furry party assembled for a DnD campaign soon! Time to grab my best set of dice!
*after all*
I see a lot of artists making great art of the anthro version of the firefox logo, but can we get a wah version? It is a red panda after.

I hate to be that guy...
Chipotle burritos are just mexican hot pockets
I made some palomas with ginger, tarragon, and aperol. Definitely getting better.

Presentation could be better though. But it’s tasty
FURRY SHOES
So the thought occurred to me: Are there any legit hedgehog sonas? And I don’t mean those cringey Sonic OCs. Sorry if that’s offensive, but I said what I said.

Thank you all for liking my ball(s).
Worked on my 3d model some more. I know it looks a little silly atm, but just a little more detailing and some work on the hands and feet, and I'll be ready for retopology!
Did a sphere study today to practice painting. It's so hard to blend, and I've been using the blending tool as a crutch. But looks solid for a first try I think.

Don’t procrastinate on calculus homework!


Need a hug today. Losing my last two irl friends soon. Now the future seems pretty bleak and empty. Even if I achieve everything I want to, I still won’t know what else to do with all the time.
The slight muffin top I had  is almost gone. Workouts are going well.
Hate being so tired on the weekend that all I want to do is drink and sleep instead of work on things
I’m gonna do it this weekend. Gonna finally sit down and make a list of all the artist I follow, see what pieces I want, and schedule some commissions. It’s a business. Gotta do your homework!
Well slowly just acknowledging the events of this week and moving forward. Just want to get my life back and focus on making art and making you guys smile.
FUCK
Man otters are so awesome. To all my otter friends, you are just the coolest!
Holy crap I need a drink. Never been kicked in the ass like I have been today before. But my chill carefree nature won today. You can’t keep a good wah down!

Winter storm ended with a bang! Literally!
Just wanted to say thanks for checking on me. I’m being over dramatic, but honestly, sitting around in the dark is no fun.
OMG THE POWER IS BACK! I SURVIVED!
Who wants to cuddle with me and...

Literally talk about anything because I’m losing my mind out of boredom.

Well no food, electricity, or water. But at least the lab’s closed. Gonna survive off of poptarts. Will hunt a mammoth if I have to
Man we need more furry games
Dang. It’s midnight, it’s cold, and I’m horny. Need pp.
Felt that.... hugs to anyone else who did as well
Man sleeping in and relaxing today in this rainy weather has just been DIVINE. I'll just have to pick up where I left off tomorrow.
Why are soy latte’s so good?

Happy Valentine’s day! Treasure your partners and never break their hearts. And for all of you single people: you are not alone, you are loved, and you are more than enough.

Your wah father loves you!
Heard we might get 3” of snow in Houston of all places. If it does, I will make a snow-wah!
Finished, but needs adjustment I think. Never happy with the pinstripe on my neck.
Update: Got my exam extension! Gotta be more careful from now on.
Oop. Missed exam day yesterday thinking it was today. Think there’s still a chance for me?
PROTOGEN DESIGN HAS BEEN UPDATED!

-Refined model with less sharp ridges in head for comfort
-Version that is cut into smaller sections for smaller 3D printers
-Insertable side panels for ease of customization
-Fixed size bug so it won't appear "micro sized" in slicer

Thinking about listening to “Moby Dick” after I finish “The Odyssey.” Do you guys have other suggestions?
Been such a long time since I used blender. Barely recognize the interface. But I got to work and here's what I got so far lol. Not a bad start I think.

I wish Howlr would display images properly. Or am I doing something wrong?
I have some commissions left and will be opening again!!
Streaming on discord with friends has been a ton of fun. Makes me feel more comfortable drawing in front of people. I’m just not professional enough to do it in front of a bunch of strangers yet.
Bagel crisps and hummus

Cried really hard today. But idk. Just listening to some pop songs and I’m ready to continue working on myself. I’m a difficult POS sometimes, but I want to be better for you guys and for myself. I thought about you all and how I love you and want to make you smile. Make your day

My clay incense burner came in! It looks so pretty, and I can stare at it for hours!
Been like 12 years since I took calculus and this homework is making feel like a dumbass lol. I feel like I shouldn’t be struggling though.

Had the most delicious concoctions today with my friends. There is so much to making good drinks. It’s really an art form!
Mini vacay with friends!
Hope you all have a great weekend!

I can’t Katy Perry’s “Cry About it Later” out of my head. It’s too catchy!
and he's done! meet aero the red panda :3

Pink foxes and wahs are extra gay. I wish I could change colors sometimes and be that fabulous too.

Judge Schroeder blocked lawyers using "victim" in front of the jury to describe the people Kyle Rittenhouse killed or wounded.

He approved describing them as "looters" and "rioters" and said a defense lawyer could "demonize them if he wants," according to
@chicagotribune
.
I knew it. Kyle Rittenhouse is proof that white people can still break the law, carry illegal weapons, shoot and kill people, and get away with it in America by shedding tears and claiming self-defense.
America continues to jail people like mothers in poverty for going to a job interview, or teens just carrying a joint on them
Yet lets white male murderers walk free. I hate this backwards ass country

#NoJusticeNoPeace had Kyle been black, there wouldn’t have even been a trial because the cops would have killed him in the street instead of letting him walk by with a giant gun on his back.

My entire first round of suiting was me getting to lobby, blinking several times then finally realizing I had a dryer sheet in the right eye of my suit head and I couldn't see out of it. XD
Didn't fix because it was too difficult to get the head on with the mask staying on. XD

Getting text messages from people at work asking me questions already.

Holy shit it's only been 4 hours
I'm about 90% sure I'm sat next to a furry on my train to Chicago but I'm too awkward to ask. XD
Up early and oh hello anxiety, been a while XD
All packed! I'm 99% sure I've not forgot anything...
100% sure I've got the most important stuff at least!

I really wish I could bring V1 Zuel too but I'll at least be bringing the BELLY BOY
No go on the dual Zuel~
It's been over 2 years since the last time I've packed for a con and I forgot that MFL Zuel does not condense much . XD
I'm trying to figure out where to start with packing, lol

Want to bring two good boys but one is the size of three. XD

My new suitcase is here and it looks more promising than I expected. Can I fit two boyos into you...
Finally managed a no death/no sub tank 100% run in Megaman X2 in 53 minutes. Time I don't much care about because I don't have what it takes to be a speed runner , lol but the no death/no sub tank part is a personal best.
I intend on getting a booster ASAP. I just know I am too late to get one before MFF.
Thank you all! <3 I started freaking out when I was being told that I "wasn't fully vaccinated without the booster shot". I started browsing CDC, my method of travel and MFF websites to find anything on boosters being required for travel and wasn't finding anything.
Alright, I need help.
I guess I might need to cancel MFF? I'm trying to figure it out. I got my vaccine (J&J) back in April 2021. I've yet to get a booster. Am I considered no longer vaccinated since it's been months and I've yet to get the booster?
If so, then I will not go.
Ayyyy
There's that pre-con anxiety!
Wondering what was in the box?

This is Mach, the bearded dragon! Big, coffee colored, chonky beardie at his full size. Completely unique and so well done!!! <3 More of this character coming soon!

Washing the big boy today.
Nearest laundromat is 30 min drive away and the washers in the complex are too small. I have to wash him in the bath tub and it is quite literally the only and most annoying/frustrating thing with this fursuit.

I'm soooo stuffed!
I am going to apologize ahead of time.
Mutuals/friends; if and when I see you again and we hug; I'm likely going to hold onto you for a bit longer than normal..
Mutuals that liked this tweet; umm... can we please? ^///^ I will HAPPILY return the favor x//3
Having a fursuiter act as a life-sized plush for me every night at MFF would be great
Anyone have any solid recommendations for a suitcase/roller bag for multiple fursuits that is big but not crazy huge?
I intend to vacuum seal bodysuits and padding but the bag I have is old and just a tad small for all of big belly Zuel and V1 Zuel even vacuum packed. XD
Redeem those viewing points for a fun surprise~

I'm almost certain my blood was the thickest syrup you've ever seen when at work I'd nearly black out from semi-strenuous activity where I never had before a month or so prior.
Can't believe I ignored something like that entirely after it happened multiple times.
I knew the symptoms, I knew my mother had it and I didn't belive that it was really what I had until I weighed myself late December and saw I dropped over 40lbs in such a short time frame without trying to.
Then I started to notice the muscular atrophy too. How did I not die?
It's strange to realize that it's been slightly over a year that I've had type 1 diabetes. I wasn't diagnosed until Christmas day but I was experiencing symptoms more heavily at this point last year.
Lol, can't believe I ignored/denied it for so long.
Uh oh

Babby might do his first stream tomorrow
For the record, if a kid shows up with a fucking AR-15 rifle in any public area I'm at and starts aiming it at myself or other people, I'm going to try like hell to take him down too. He's the threat and essentially a loose canon.

Brought it for self defense? Kiss my ass.
Absolute. Fucking. Bullshit.

Was really considering trying to do a stream today but I have nothing ready, lol
*gets let off work two hours early with everyone else*

Me: "Woo!"

Me: *30 min after getting home takes a 4 hour nap*
How the fuck am I on a no death run of Megaman X2 while slightly tipsy? Like.. is it helping me?? How has this been my most perfected run yet? Lol.

It's almost like it has smoothed out all my rough edges.

I'm a true soft boy now
This belly is irresistibly cuddly..

Oh no, I got MVP for the month of October. The month I was on vacation for 10 days during a very busy time. Lmao
It's 2023.

You're at your favorite fur con.

Fursuiters won't hug you unless you are an ELITETIER patron on their Patreon.
*$500 Tier*

-GUARANTEED chance to squirm in my fursuit belly for 5 min at a con we are both at

-GUARANTEED one belly smooshing

-PRIVILEGE to chat in my discord

-You can rub my fursuit belly for at least one whole minute!

-I will type "*hug*" at you twice a month.
Isn't Garo the hero killer guy from One Punch Man?
Pretty confident I am going so why not?
Maybe someday I'll get over my fears and stream some stuff. I still have to learn/figure out how to first. XD
I feel like I could be entertaining enough!
If it ever goes anywhere or I discover I enjoy it, I'd consider a v-tuber avatar or a webcam for fursuit things. ^^
OK
I need to get a granny outfit that will fit my fursuit and dress as the Big Bad Wolf who swallowed granny for Halloween. XD
Instead of painting a jack-o-latern on your belly, why not swallow one whole and watch it glow through your belly? :3c
I've considered taking my niece and nephews trick or treating a couple times wearing thin/regular Zuel but I've always chickened out. I think I am mostly afraid of the slim chance of being recognized in public. XD

Maybe someday I'll get over it.
I don't remember if I have ever been to a Halloween party.. Lol

I haven't done anything for Halloween since I last trick or treated 20+ years ago. XD

I need change that next year.
My brother got a border collie puppy a few weeks ago and I got to meet her today. Omg she is the ABSOLUTE CUTEST THING EVER!   Such a perfect lil' puppo! Soo much energy! She was just nonstop playing, sniffing around and giving the whole fam puppy kisses XD
MY HEART
I'm no speed runner but being able to clear Megaman X without dying once or using a sub tank in 50 minutes is pretty neat. No Hadouken either.
Here we go, this looks about right~
I scored a new pen at work today
It's morning and it's time. #VoreDay
I won't ever sugar coat the fact that I have made multiple mistakes in my life.. I also don't expect people to like me or forgive me for them. I want to be better for everyone. I want everyone to feel love/joy/happiness in their lives. You all deserve it. <3
I'm not sure if I will continue the Megaman X series beyond X4. I love X-X3 but X4 is like a completely different game to me.
Me after a midnight snack
Yesterday I had a 16oz New York strip steak with mushrooms and onions on it, a loaded baked potato, and steamed beans/carrots for dinner.

A little over an hour later, I was hungry again. XD

I'm 34, going on 50
Shaving to baby face usually improves my chances since grey is starting to appear in my beard more
Every time I get carded when I buy alcohol now I thank the person that cards me like an awkward still young looking old person
My job helped me get a covid vaccine before a doctor would and now they are giving me (and other vaccinated folks) a $500 bonus for being vaccinated. Just show proof to HR and bam, $500. This incentive shouldn't be needed. Yet people still won't get it. Wtf..
I was gonna be a good boy and try a healer class next in FF14 but I keep eyeing that Archer/Bard
Oh hey!

Any mutuals going to MCFC 2021 by chance?
Please smother/bully me with all the big fursuit bellies and boobs that exist >////>
I'm feeling the urge to go through the Megaman X collection again. Only this time doing X4-X8 which I've never played them before.

If I had what I needed and knew how I'd record it. XD
Okay, that's 3 jobs at 50 now

Feeling burned out already lol
Vore
You're all wrong

It's Voretember >:3c
stopit.jpg
So paladins are okay

But black mages are FUN

I've gotten both to 50 so far in FF14 and I have more fun hurling an assortment of elements at enemies than the two button mashing that is tanking. I think I'll try out a healing and melee dps class next.
There are kinks that people place as more SFW than vore and inflation that I really don't like or care to see but see it all the time but you know what?

I just don't care and go about my day, lol

Like this if you wanna be in my fursuit belly
「   HEAVEN  OR  HELL   」
...depends on who you ask. >:9c
Oh, and I forgot about this that I drew earlier while the internet went kaput for a moment. Chibi

*works ass off all day in hopes of getting Friday off like 60% of the staff*

Boss: "By the way, I have you scheduled for tomorrow. It's not like we will need you but in case we have a call in.."

*regrets busting ass all morning*
Furry fandom ladies need more recognition. Furry fandom ladies need a space to be respected. Furry fandom ladies need more validation. There's so many women in the fandom who are artists and suit makers that the fandom won't be what it is without the ladies
Biting off a bit more than I can chew here but it's more fun to swallow them whole :9c

..okay.... maaaybe I should've chewed this one.. >.<;

#Megaplex2021 #Megaplex
I have such a mighty need to cuddle and snooze with a fursuiter.
Omg I love remixes of old game songs
I swear this is one of the most relaxing songs ever to me. XD
I'm going to pick up drawing again. I've been having urges to.
Need to learn how to stop getting down on myself about my skill level so I won't keep taking these month/year(s) breaks from it. XD

I'll do that first
Perfect timing. Only have 15 hours left of my subscription. XD

Goodbye WoW Classic. I won't be playing through the entire second time.
Well I knew Blizzard sucked. Then Activision made them suck more. Now they REALLY suck with recent news. Honestly could leave WoW without batting an eye.
I've yet to read more about it but I'm already considering dropping this shit immediately.
I'm literally a child
And you all thought my belly was too big :P

Been a while since I've posted for #FursuitFriday ! And it's late..
So have some pics of a VERY satisfied sleepy doggo :3c
So I ended up joining the guild for a Kara raid tonight and wow, I don't remember a damn thing about it from way back.. XD
I rarely raided in the original release of TBC. I remember fighting the Curator and the chess event but I think I just PvPed like a mad man back then. XD

Dang
Coming to the realization that it's been since late summer 2019 since I last fursuited with friends.
Soo by the time I'll probably be able to again it will have been over 2 years

Fuck..

Imagine how awesome it would be rollin up to fight bowser in the next Mario game  and this plays as you start the stage
Ever notice that the people that are awesome in leadership roles, don't want to do it or got out the role but the people that are really bad at it are always in a leadership role?

Feels bad man
*sees cute art on feed*
Me: "Ahh, that's cute! I recognize one of those characters.."
*clicks their handle*
"YOU ARE BLOCKED"

Neat.
Damn. I can't see actual numbers so now I don't know if its Druid or Hunter. XD
Because I'm a loser, here's the rest.

I've played Warlock and Mage to 70 before but have neither one started in Classic yet.
So I'm playing WoW Burning Crusade Classic a lot. My main is an Enhancement Shaman nearing lvl 70.
What class should I level up next? (Only listing those I have at 42-60)
It's incredibly wild to me that by random chance, I ran into a prior guild master in WoW Classic that I used to raid with years ago when Cataclysm was the fresh expansion. Recognized the name, decided to poke them and it was actually the same person. How fucking awesome is that?
Aaaaand burnt the last one! :'D

Imma go cry myself back to sleep XD
And I messed up the first one on the first flip :'3
Awwh yeah chocolate chip pancakes

I transferred servers on WoW Classic since the one I was on seemed like a ghost town.

This new one is BUMPIN' wow

Already had several random guild invites and the auction house has 500+ more pages than the previous server on their best day.

Should've done this sooner lol
Post an image of yourself as the final boss without downloading new pics.
I can never decide on which class I want to main in WoW so I will always have every class at max level with crap gear. XD
I never remember when any of these gaming conventions/announcement things happen.
The first and only one I've remembered is BlizzCon this weekend because I want to know when I'll be playing TBC Classic. XD
Who says a dog can't enjoy and rub his big soft tum on Valentine's Day?

Self love is important after all!

Happy Valentine's Day all!
Pls n thx

BANDWAGON!
The Sketch --------- > The finished product!
So

Random ass thought

What if I became a WoW streamer once/if WoW TBC Classic comes out?

I thrived at PvP back in Burning Crusade and I'm heavily considering a relapse XD
Black is beautiful and nothing can or ever will change that.
I hope big pharma gets fucked real soon
I know it isn't my fault. XD
But paying out of pocket over $450 for long acting insulin and then $820 for short acting and a glucagon kit makes it seem like living is a luxury when it cost less than fucking $10 to make
With how much insulin costs it almost feels like getting type 1 diabetes is my fault and the high price tag is the "fuck you, go die" instead from capitalist America.
Never thought I would say this but developing type 1 diabetes is the best thing that ever happened to me.

Lol, I know it doesn't sound right but I needed a good slap to get my shit straight.
I'm not sure if I've ever made this clear even though it should be clear by now.

If you support Trump in any way you are not welcome here and you can go fuck yourself to hell.
There's an Alliance guild called Trump Loyalists in WoW Classic on this server..

I've never played Alliance and now I never will.
With this year ending in ER trip Christmas day and a life altering diagnosis for me that I've been suspect of for the last couple of months and how this year has been in general

Is keyboard screen burn a common thing in Samsung Note phones? It happened with my Note 4 and I'm starting to see it on my Note 8 screen now. I don't ever have the keyboard up long enough and I never have the backlight maxed out.

Me, day one after the quarantine and social distancing ends~
*starts work week with 2 tabs open in company's website*

*ends work week closing 15 tabs of company's website*
Quarantine has left me hungry
In other news, I got a new water cooler and RAM yesterday, installed them and now my PC is back to beast mode. :D
If I had a "year's supply of oreos", I'd have them all eaten in 3 months.
I'm a literal monster
Oddly enough, using a 2012 heatsink on a 2017 i7 processor and a single 8GB stick of RAM, PC seems to run alright! XD
It's like a salvage project now. XD I'm using an old heat sink off a 2012 built PC that happened to fit and now a single RAM stick until new parts arrive. The heatsink isn't great but it's keeping it from hitting dangerous temps.
Early on I had lots of BSOD relating to memory management but every test showed me nothing defining. Resetting Windows always fixed it and it would be months before another issue.
Always cursed Windows 10 because something like an audio driver can render the entire OS useless.
My PC is falling apart. XD
I put off ordering a new cooling unit because I couldn't decide on what I wanted but now I need to replace my RAM too!
Turns out one of my RAM sticks is bad and I have a suspicion it's been bad since I got it over 2 years ago. :/

I love how I have over a dozen images on my phone of days I tried to hit the snooze on my alarm and instead took a screenshot of the alarm going off
Oh man! Such a missed opportunity too! I should've wore the MVP hoodie from the new job! XD

TL;DR: I was given a gift card and the nice hoodie for getting the MVP award my third month of employment. :3
Went to the store to buy trash bags and didn't really think about how much of a mad house it would be. Oops

Saw my old boss off his butt and working. He never looked my way or acknowledged me which is a shame because I had the biggest grin on my face. XD
I literally just tried to shove 4 double stuffed oreos in my mouth all at once subconsciously..
I wanted a snack. But I kind of want to enjoy it, brain.

I guess that's what I get for having a hundred things on my mind at once. XD
In all the years and hard work I put in at my old job, things like this I would never hear. I would only get more expectations and hear about complaints.
It sucks that I tolerated it for over a decade, believing I wouldn't find better and believing all burdens were mine to bare.
My 3 month review at the new job;

Time management: Excellent
Reliability: Excellent
Quality: Excellent
Safety: Excellent

Supervisor: "We would like to see you take your breaks. You need your rest whether you think so or not."

Me: "Huh. Okay, I will work on that."

Saw a classmate of mine that I haven't seen in YEARS while at work today. He was such a character in school and still is, oh man. XD That chance encounter made my day infinitely better and getting to catch up with him a bit was a treat.

I also can't believe it had already been two years since the last time I played anything on Steam. x.x

Once I get myself caught up with things I owe, I think I'll give streaming a try!
I played UT2004 for the last few nights just to get the feel of playing a FPS again.
Also InstaGib CTF against the CPU on Inhuman difficulty is a great way to fast train your skills. XD I've played a handful of matches and already notice how much faster and accurate I am.

This is by far the most important thing my psychologist has taught me and once it clicked -why- you have to do it (not to change your opinion but purely to stop the spiral) it was so much easier to do and has really improved my outlook over time (Part 1 of 2, check the replies!)

I've been told a few times that I would be good at Twitch streaming or YouTube but I don't know. XD

The best part was that it also had a pull string to it and it would say phrases in her own voice. One specific one I remember was "No dabbing!!!"
I had a dream last night that I was visiting
@SmellyStrobes
 and
@NexusFolf
 and Gale had a plush of herself that looked identical to her fursuit. The wild thing was the fursuit was removable.. only to reveal the other fursuit version underneath. It was awesome. XD
As some of you guys know, today is #VoreDay, and what better way to celebrate this day than with huge tummy boy himself,
@Zuelansi
! I hope you enjoyed your meal
Happy birthday to this fatty! I'm sure he wouldn't mind some snacks for his gifts :3
Happy Birthday to both of the wonderful
@Moooozle

Retweet if the furry fandom has ever:

Helped with your depression or mental illness

Been a place you found lasting friendships or even a partner

Introduced you to people in other states or countries

Improved your communication skills and teamwork

Inspired you
UH OH

Thank you to all of you that stick by me and are patient with me regardless of the ugly parts of myself that I've unfortunately shown the most of lately. It means a lot to me and no words could express that properly.
I have a lot to take care of.. Most are personal issues, lack of self confidence and other reasons I wish not to discuss. Each day has been a grueling internal battle for years now. I've not been my best self in a very long time.
Unfortunately I've been hesitant because of family/relatives and everything I know being here. Breaking such a comfort zone (among others..) will be a sort of feat for someone like me. I would love to be surrounded by who I consider my second family someday.
I've been to the northeast/New England area many times the last few years and it has been making it difficult to stay in Michigan. I love it up there. Lots of good friends and a lot to see and do within decent driving distance. I'm missing friends hardcore already.
Not going to lie, getting smooshed by tiny Zuel was pretty amazing. X3

And I had such a fantastic view!
If I ever get back into playing guitar, I'm learning how to play the Swat Kats intro
Most furries: "I love
@BenjaminDiskin
's voice in Aggretsuko!"

Me after reading his bio for AC2019: "He is who voice acted for Ban in the English dubbed version of The Seven Deadly sins!? I love his voice!"

(I've yet to watch Aggretsuko for context XD)
"I was working on my tan."

"Hmm.. I think you are tanning the sun at this point." XD
So I've been asked a few times about what would happen if I belched and well...

It was a big one.. >.>;;
Talking with
@NexusFolf

Flops on fleek
Me: "It's not possible to floss in my suit."
@EigenRovak
: *5 minutes after putting on my suit*
Decided to delete my tweets because I started to feel they did more harm than good. I apologize.

It's about time I took a long break.
Got paid my overtime and didn't get a write up nor a chat. They're learning! :D
So the hole right after the chip in birdie was a long par 3 and I very nearly had a hole in one! XD It rolled right over the left side of the cup from off the tee with a 5 wood. I two putted for par though XD
My overall score was terrible but I did much better than I expected to!
I'm finally out golfing for my first time this year and I chipped in for a birdie on the fifth hole. Chipping is my weakness what the heck. XD
Grab a friend and hug

If I ever get a plushie of Zuel

he will have a belly

..because he ate all my other plushies...?

Cleaned up entire apartment as an odd way to relieve stress but needed to be in bed for a 7am flight tomorrow x.x
Weeeelll. Due to oversized luggage fees being absolutely absurd, I'm only able to bring one fursuit to BLFC.

V2 takes up all the space (and then some). HE'S SUCH A BIG BOY
I'm not letting it take away my trip and it doesn't seem like it's severe enough to stop me. Been doing my own research but anyone with experience to contribute would be greatly appreciated!
Random question! Have any of you ever experienced an exertion headache and how long did it take for it to stop happening?
I've been researching a lot on my own but can't get in to see a doctor before flying out for BLFC tomorrow.
Happy Birthday to the super sweet @_foxchow !
Hope you have a great one! :D

I strongly believe that the closest thing people have to psychic powers is in that moment between when a hairdresser touches your hair for the first time  and right before she says “so what are we doin today?” where she can see your entire past, present, and future.
No but why are there senior discounts? They had a whole ass head start on me in life and they still get an advantage.
Seeing

So
@Twitch
 @TwitchSupport

Riding this wave too. This was at my pre-covid weight. I really want to have the confidence to share my face and body again. It’s been really tough lately.
In search of access to an ancient ruin that supposedly housed an amulet fragment we desired, we had to curry favor with the College of Winterhold.  Though beautiful, it was rife with collusion and deceit.
The real reason my human form can't be a VTuber model is because the technology to render my giant supermassive gravity-warping thicc ass doesn't exist yet.

WTF,
@Twitch
?! Neither of these images falls in the categories you removed them over.
How is this nto obviously biased, is what I wanna know. THey act like they are unbiased, but this shit makes it obvious they jsut don't care and remove any emote from smaller/furry/lgbt streamers anyone complaisn abotu and slaps this stupid thing on it as a reason
@TwitchSupport
, you have some seriously stupid moderation.
@TwitchSupport
 wtf
@TwitchSupport
 yo there's nothing sexual about those emotes you should fix your system
@TwitchSupport
 can you please get an actual person to review emotes? In what world are these emotes Sexual? I've seen plenty of users who still have gasm styled emotes but this gets removed?

Hey Everyone! I just wanted to let you all know that I have updated my commission prices and you can see what I have to offer here!
Day 2 of MFF's artist alley is done for me and it was even more livelier than yesterday! Thanks to everyone who stopped by and I just wanted to mention that Sunday will be my last day in the alley and I will be there selling wares until 3pm since I have to catch an early flight!
I spotted
@sailorrooscout
 in front of my table earlier today!
This is the scene on display right beside my table, I think it's a reference to the Nativity story.
Day 2 of MFF is on! Come find me in the artist alley!
Happy Birthday
@WolfPsalm
! Hope you have a great one today and here's a colored bust of your sona in her tribal warrior form for you! #furryart
I spotted
@auroraabloom
 who was suiting last night!
Day 1 of MFF is done for me, Thanks to everyone who stopped by my table in the artist alley! Got to meet more old friends too!
Here's a full body sketch comm of a Fennec fox lady warrior!
Got my table all set up in the MFF artist alley where I'll be selling prints and offering commissions all week! Just look for the Canadian flags!
In case anyone wants to find me at MFF, here are my badges that I'll have on all week. One of them was done by @/Houndsaint and two of them were done by
@nicnak044
!
My feet are killing me, but It was fun to explore the Hyatt and the convention center again after 2 years since the last time I was here as well seeing old friends here too! And now I'm ready to set everything up at my artist marketplace table for tomorrow, Looking forward to it!
Oh yeah, MFF is back baby!
I finally made it at my hotel in Chicago and I'm heading to the main MFF hotel for reg shortly!
I still love this art piece of my sona! Thanks again
@SanthanVutha
 :D
I'm going to be leaving for MFF later today and I also wanted to mention I will be on a short hiatus on my queue until I return home to my workstation on Monday!
Space Jams
Who else is ready for MFF?
I got my PCR test results and there were negative which means MFF is officially on for me! This was the last thing I was stressing about all week imagining all this preparation could've been for nothing but that's not the case fortunately!
And also the storyline plays out like sort of a lost Toy Story movie too which is pretty cool.
Been playing some more of KH3 to feel less stressed about my MFF trip. The Toy Story world is definitely one of my favourites so far, aside from the huge nostalgia trip it's also very meta and nearly 4th wall breaking at times. Also a ton of great background details as well.
I saw Encanto earlier tonight and I thought it was really good! It's a story about family and dealing with trauma and felt quite relatable as well.
We are pleased to announce a partnership with Vitality Urgent Care at Midwest FurFest 2021. If you are returning to a country which requires a negative RT-PRC / NAAT COVID-19 test before returning home, please see our website to learn more:
If you need a test to return home from MFF and can find a ride or an Uber, book your Covid test at Walgreens! There is one 10 minutes from the con with plenty of appointments. Their NAAT test is free and returns results within 24 hours, which us Canadians can use to go home!
I finally started playing Kingdom Hearts 3 after catching up on the story so far and even though I'm just pretty much at the beginning of the game, I think this might be the most epic game I've ever played in my life haha. Olympus alone felt like an entire God of War game LOL
Here's a Christmas card-themed commission done for

I got this walkthrough of Kingdom Hears: Dream Drop Distance playing while I'm working, it looks pretty cool but I'm glad I'm just watching because I do not have the time or energy to go find and play this game for PS4 when I've waited too damn long already to play KH3 LOL

Happy Thanksgiving to all my American friends!
I'm having a Black Friday special from now until next Tuesday! If you're interested in getting something from me, send me a DM!
There's still other KH stuff I plan to watch to catch up on the overall story before I eventually get into playing KH3. But BBS really helped me uncluttered my mind in a mental/creative way because that game made me felt motivated to create more art and finishing up my work.
To make a comparison it's like if KH 1 is A New Hope & KH 2 is Empire Strikes Back, BBS is like the prequel trilogy rolled into one but I love the fact that it was a prequel and it helped me reconnect with the Kingdom Hearts series and reminded me why I loved those games so much.
I know it's an older game but this was a game I had to complete first before delving into Kingdom Hearts 3 which I can't wait to get into during the holidays but something about BHS' structure and gameplay was really cool and I felt the story was one of the best in the whole saga
It took me 6 years or so but I finally got around to beating Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep and I thought overall that was an amazing game! I was previously immersed in a lot of strategy games for a long time, I forgot how refreshing a JRPG could be and it gave me a mental boost.
So... who will I be seeing at MFF next week?
I'm now offering MFF badges for pickup at my artist marketplace table! These will be open until this Sunday so if you're interested in getting one send me a DM!
Here's another pinup I did of my cat lady character Mayflower!
Ghostbusters: Afterlife was awesome! It felt like a hybrid film between the original Ghostbusters and The Goonies directed by Steven Spielberg and it was definitely a lot of fun!
What a funky little crew. Boy sure wish nothing bad happens to them mhmhmhm.

Look at all the neat stuff I bought at
@CanFURence
!
Also I finally got word that I will have a spot at MFF's artist marketplace so I'm definitely looking forward to returning and bringing my new artwork with me after an unexpected 2 year break!
Having to put up with how this site treats artists wanting to share their work & expand their businesses certainly didn't help either but after such a great weekend being to able to talk with people again I feel re-energized now, and I got that drive back to work on new art too!
I'm not sure if I mentioned this to all of my friends at canFURence, at least not in great detail but I've been dealing with burnout ever since the middle of summer this year and that really affected my mental health, my drive and motivation to work on art for a long time.-
Overall I had an awesome time at canFURence, it felt amazing to be reunited with people I haven't seen in person in such a long time and I'm looking forward to attending next year's con in 2022!
and I missed being at cons to engage with people directly who were interested in my art and not having to deal with any filters that may have prevented my artwork from being seen online here.-
I was also very happy with how well I did business wise over the weekend since working as a online-only artist was quite a struggle for a long time for me and dealing with a slump in sales after the previous con I was at prior to everything shutting down-
It was like cons haven't skipped a beat at all and everything felt like it was back to normal now. And big thanks to both the con and hotel staff who helped make it feel that way as well!-
This weekend at
@canFURence
 was the most fun I've had in a long time and It was awesome to be able to see my friends and familiar faces again in person after such a long hiatus!-
BOOYAH!!
We are thrilled to announce that CanFURence 2021 is officially a GO for an IN-PERSON event: Friday Nov. 12th- Sunday Nov. 14th!

I FINALLY got to see DUNE at my local theatre and it was incredible! It reminded me of when I saw Fellowship of the Ring for the first time, the visuals are epic and you can really feel the scope behind it. I'm glad we finally have a worthy adaptation & I look forward to part 2!
I had the chance to see the latest My Hero Academia movie before it left my local theatre for good, I thought it was great and entertaining all the way through!

You can find my gallery in my profile as well!
Just wanted to say Happy Thanksgiving to my fellow Canadians here!
I finished watching Squid Game just now and overall I thought it was really good, definitely a wild ride with some of those later games too.
THIS FIGHT IS SPECIAL.

#FuryWilder3
This was the greatest Heavyweight fight I've ever seen in my life Tyson Fury is a living legend! #FuryWilderIII
London
Paris
New York
Hong Kong
Phnom Pehn
also PROTIP: If you see interesting fanart of a character from a series you haven't seen yet, do yourself a favour and just save the image but don't click on the post because some idiots will post giant spoilers without warning at all & I happened to saw one so don't do that LOL
I started watching Squid Game last night and I was already intrigued but after the second one I got really engaged with these characters and I plan to binge through most of them soon. It's got some Parasite vibes but you can feel that Battle Royale and Gambler Kaiji influence too
Boyfriend found out his school closed permanently in the middle of his degree. His income was through military education benefits.
We will be losing a lot of income. I’ll be pushing more art, as I’ll be the main income for a while.

Prices negotiable
Please turn on the notification bell for artists you love, comment on their work, retweet it if you can, twitters new algorithm has been making it hard for so sooo many artists to make ends meet lately !!!
Right now It's definitely a struggle for me to figure out how to do better here, such as finding more ways to deal with the algorithm, or focusing on putting better and more content out there while accepting the fact that other people may not be ready to spend again just yet.
I feel when we see furry artists at cons doing good business in person stimulating the incomes for a lot of artists, more people will feel more confident to spend on more art again and it will feel like the entire furry economy will recover and get back on track.
I'm looking forward to sell at cons in person again because I feel I'm able to do better that way and also engage with a lot more people with a better opportunity to showcase my work in one place, rather than feeling like a small ripple in the giant ocean that twitter is.
that's restricting certain posts that artists make stating that they're open for commissions, YCHs, adopts, etc and that's going to have to force us to adapt and find new ways to market ourselves here such as image posts with all our pricing info and stating they we're open rn.
I feel the furry art economy has taking a lot of hits lately, I see artists struggling and saying they're getting less interaction and business and I wonder if that's reflective of the poor state of the US/Canada economy or if it's just because of the troublesome algorithm here-
Here's a picture I did of my cat lady character Mayflower doing some warm-up stretches before getting in a good workout!

I feel kinda bad that I kinda let #swordtember slip past by without drawing a dedicated sword-themed picture based off the prompt list, but I was really busy this month working on a lot of things but here are some sword themed pictures that I did on my own this month!

This was a pretty legendary fight, it had a lot of drama LOL
Thought I'd include my commission prices here too!
Here's a picture I did of Juno from Beastars with a warm cup of coffee early in the morning and greeting her husband Louis who woke up just now.
THIS SO MUCH!! Dealers are a HUGE part of a convention, And should 100% get priority over leisure con-goers! Majority of these artists rely on conventions and booths for their income & pay their bills!! They vend 8 hrs a day, most with no break, and deserve to have a CLOSE ROOM!
Here's a pinup I did of Juno from Beastars wearing one of those old school Japanese PE uniforms!

Nicely done everyone
Been working on a lot of stuff, coloring in commissions and planning out other pictures but I plan to post a lot more stuff here soon once it's done! in the mean time here's a sketch of a rat templar I did recently for fun!
I still have this one YCH pose available! comment below if you'd like to claim it! (example included)
I got back from seeing SHANG-CHI in theatres just now and I went in with low expectations but I thought it was really good! It's been too long since I seen a fun martial-arts film and there was good choreography on display here. The ten rings as a weapon/power looks cool too.
Time to do the thing!

I don't know how I missed this ABSURD rate increase, but, uh, looks like all my future payments will be Stripe invoices unless you can only use PayPal. The extra .20 cents per transaction is 100% an attack on small business owners and people receiving tips, & I can't support that

Here's a summer themed YCH pinup commission done for
@FortifyingFloof

I finally finished watching "Evangelion 3.0+1.0" the last one in the rebuild series & I thought it was simply epic and incredible. It might top "End of Evangelion" for me in terms of how the this iteration of the series resolved everything. I'll be thinking about it for a while.
In honour of the last Rebuild of Evangelion film coming out today, here's a couple of fan art pieces I did of Asuka and Rei a couple of years when I first got into the series! I might make some more fan art after watching it too.
I decided to watch all the Rebuild of Evangelion films in anticipation for the 4th film, the storyline is pretty streamlined compared to the original series, but the new animation and visuals look awesome. I think my favourite in the new series so far was the 2nd film.
Can we pretend...

Seeing photos of Megaplex going on right now, makes me wish I could be down there too. I really miss being a vendor at cons and seeing friends too.
I saw THE SUICIDE SQUAD just now and I thought it was a really great film! It had a lot of good action, it was funny, It's vibrant & colorful compared to some other DC films, and the way it plays with the narrative & the level of violence is almost like if Tarantino directed it.
i know i somewhat dropped off the art fandom / furry fandom twitter timeline but if anyone wanted a custom commission, my inbox is open. I dont have many recent examples of art but my Instagram (
@narndraws

I heard it was #NationalUnderwearDay today so in honor of that here are some underwear themed art I've done haha

This was also the first time I experienced the poem that it's based on "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight" and I wanted to see what the original source material was all about immediately after seeing it, I think it was a very interesting and also weird interpretation of it overall.
I just saw THE GREEN KNIGHT and I thought it was a really deep psychological drama/character study that felt very grounded in this fantasy setting. It's definitely not your usual fantasy film but it's an experience like most A24 films are and a visually stunning one as well.
In honor of #InternationalTigerDay here are some of my favourite tiger character designs that I've done either for myself or as a commission!
I got a set of YCH summer-themed pinups for sale!

This month was really busy for me and because I wasn't able to get as many artfight themed pictures made as I would've like, there's still some time and there's at least two characters I'm interested in drawing but we'll see if I can make it, otherwise it's future gift art.

Just wanted to say hello to my new followers and thanks for the support on my f/ursofcolor post! I've been working on some large-scale pictures that need a lot of time to get right and it was very motivating to see that and I hope to be able to show you all my new work very soon!
Have been going back to check out the Fursofcolor tag all morning, highly recommend sorting by Latest and looking through to find folks to follow! Gotta be one of my fav tags and I'm so glad it's back, it's rly refreshing to see the wide scope of talent & diversity in furry
I had to quickly do some bloodwork at the hospital this morning and I come back here to see a bunch of new followers which is pretty cool to see and among them is
@ritwells
 and I'm just absolutely stunned LOL

Finally I can relate to this picture:
Hey #fursofcolor, I'm Santhan, a Cambodian-Canadian illustrator from Ontario, Canada & I like making pictures of furry characters in either fantasy/sci-fi, historical or slice-of-life settings! And I'm also part of that small group of Southeast Asian furries out there as well!
Also I don't really know Lebron James that well as a person, I never followed his career or seen any of his games so it was kind of hard for me to relate but I just thought of him here as like a cartoon version of him to follow along.
I genuinely feel they tried to add more dramatic depth with the main story this time around, compared to the first one which is more of a fun earnest sports film. There were some funny moments but there could've made room for more. The artistry behind the Tunes is great though.
Finished #SpaceJam 2 just now & here are my thoughts:

+Amazing animation & designs for the Tunes
+Colorful visuals
+A bit more dramatic compared to the first one

- Acting is either okay or awkward
- IP's there don't have much to do
- Not as funny as the 1st one

Overall: 6/10
Finished rewatching the original Space Jam, I remember seeing this when I was really young and it still remains a fun movie to me to this day. Just a lot of imaginative visuals and feeling like an earnest sports movie, also great soundtrack that holds up too. Now on to part 2!
The nostalgia from the original is already overwhelming
Gonna rewatch Space Jam before seeing Space Jam 2

I absolutely DESPISE that song, it's the most annoying thing ever recorded.
Since normally I would be at Anthrocon this weekend selling in the artist alley around this time of year, In keeping with that tradition I'm opening for July commissions! Here are my prices and examples and If you're interested in getting something from me send me a DM!
If Artfight can't help me get back my log-in info soon, I'm just going to start my own Art guerilla war and attack artists that I know and don't know in asymmetrical fashion.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the birthday wishes you guys sent me yesterday! It definitely marks a big seminal  year for me and potentially a big turning point in my life as well and it meant a lot for me to hear them from you all!
Want to support artist's you like? Consider ringing that bell. I know it's pretty much a meme now, but twitter is hiding more and more of our posts.
Kean and I are the only 2 Cambodian furry artists in existence and he does great work and you should definitely check it out!
Guess who just hit the big 3-0 today?
Don't know if anyone here cares at all about soccer aka football but Czech Republic and Belgium beating 2 of the top 10 teams makes this year's Euro cup very interesting in terms of shaking things up.
I only watch the anime of My Hero Academia but I keep seeing vague manga spoilers everywhere here...make it stop LOL
I thought it was odd that I didn't feel sleepy until 1am and it takes a while after that before I actually sleep. DAMN
Thinking about being able to go back to Canfurence this year definitely gives me a lot of motivation to get through my work. I got a lot of ideas to look into and merch to restock, I feel like I accepted a UFC title fight and now I got five months to prepare & train for it haha
RT's Appreciated!

I wasn't able to make a new picture for it this year but here's the first Father's Day themed picture I did featuring my rat character Niles with his cat son Aazim as a toddler back when they were both much younger!
Still open for a few commission slots this month!
I finished watching "Luca" and I thought it was really good! It's the story of a scalie learning to live among humans, a classic coming-of-age story with a little bit of Ghibli influences too.

Characters also do this  a lot too.
Here's a DnD themed commission done for

@Roxyjen1990

Ratchet and Clank.
I saw that trailer for the new Final Fantasy Origin game and It's so WEIRD LOL, the character designs just feels out of place with the setting and I've played FF1 and it had a very distinct art style that immersed you in that world but here they feel like they don't belong at all
Here's a Warhammer themed commission done for

I feel this would be the most ballsy move an artist could do LOL
Don't know how other artists feel about this but I'd rather work when it's cold compared to when it's hot, hard for me to concentrate in the heat and sweating LOL

I miss winter and snow, yeah there I said it it's the most productive time to be an artist.
So I'm kinda at a loss guys, I just want to draw and paint I don't want to keep dealing with broken computer shit all the time, my computer skills are like...a 2 at best LOL. And I guess I'm too sentimental about this PC because it's saved a lot of stuff & been through a lot too.
And these crashes usually occur when I linger too long on an actual video or some certain sites with a lot of flashy ads and activity but now it's gotten to the point where It could crash anytime & early on too and obviously this is causing me serious delays on my work right now.
Now I got another art program that's pretty much the same on my 2nd PC and I can use it just fine there but...
I just want my current PC to just stay awake long enough so that I can work on art is all. I don't even play games on it because of the frequent crashes.
I've been meaning to move everything to my 2nd computer as my new workstation but the problem with that is I have a ton of art files here which is very cumbersome to move and also more importantly my main program Photoshop CS3 is here and I can't install that on my new PC at all.
I got a bad problem with my main workstation computer guys, the graphics driver keeps crashing at me and goes to black even when I don't have any webpages open in the background while I'm working on a painting almost like it's narcoleptic and it's affecting my work queue atm.
Here's a DnD themed half-body commission done for

Just a heads up I'll be opening for a new batch of commissions later this week on June 4th! And since June is also my birthday month I'm thinking about including a discount on commission themes that I really like so keep a lookout for that post this Friday if you're interested!
Here's a Starfinder-themed half body bust commission done for
@Skorix96
!
Here's a sketch I did of an English cocker spaniel spearman back around 2017-18 that I finished up recently! I remember wanting to branch out in different breeds for canine characters and to depict more of them in military roles as a worldbuilding exercise.
So by the time my birthday comes around in June I hope I'm able to start going down that road to accomplish all these goals I have and just leave all these regrets behind and just keep going forward to make that all happen.
two of which are getting married and raising kids along with my work goal which to start making my own comic/graphic novel by now. Sometimes it gets me down but I try to push forward and I tell myself if I can just save enough money I can make all of those goals happen.
In exactly one month from now I'm going to be turning 30 and I'm going to be honest with you guys, I am NOT looking forward to this at all LOL. First of all I never expected it would occur during a pandemic but also I feel bad I haven't fulfilled any important life goals yet-
It's snowing in Ontario again....in late May
Here's a sketch I did of a Toad knight back in 2017! I think I was inspired by Frog (aka Glenn) from Chrono Trigger and wanted to do my own take on an amphibian warrior to contrast with the usual medieval mammal anthro warrior characters I've done!
Starfox of course, followed by Mother.
To all commissioners. Do more of this! We love it when we can clearly see what you want us to draw! As a result, we can create a better visualized piece of art than with just text descriptions. Trust me, no diagram or stick figure is too rudimentary.

I never read Berserk and I've only seen a few clips of the anime but I think it's a terrible tragedy that this great artist Kentaro Miura wasn't able to complete his life's work. It definitely left a big impact on people and I might start reading it from the beginning soon.
EGGMAN, IT'S TIME TO DUEL
Here's a sketch of a wolf fighter I did back around 2017-18 and back then I feel I had a completely different style/approach to drawing furry characters and I think it took a while to refine my skills. This sketch remained unfinished for a while until I went back in to finish it.
What's a movie you feel like watching again?

For me I feel the urge to watch at least one of these 3 films again for some reason:

-The Lord of the Rings trilogy
-Princess Mononoke
-Apocalypse Now
Here's a sketch of an otter fighter that I started around 2017-18 and finished recently. I wanted to make this particular fighter stand out a bit so I gave him a pair of ironwood war clubs inspired by Fijian culture, a Totokia and a Sali.
Was rooting for burgos but i enjoyed it regardless https://twitter.com/UFCArabMedia/status/1393756412501704707/video/1…

Imagination run amok

I'm sure I have a lot of people to update on and a huge pile of work to do now but I wanted to let you all know that I am back now, better than ever & I want to thank everyone who stuck around here during this very difficult time for me. Thank you very much for thinking about me!
-I feel very similar to Sherlock Holmes without a case and I feel that without something to engage with I deteriorate mentally & that was certainly the case during the later half of my stay when the trajectory of my recovery was on the rise and that's just what I want to do now.
mind and despite having multiple injections and dealing with exhaustion when I first came here. I feel I have I had a long enough break already and I truly don't want to delay anything further so I've been feeling just raring to go back to my canvas and continue working because-
I wasn't able to get a decent wi-fi connection during my entire stay here and wanted to give you proper daily updates but I wasn't able to get that chance so I hope I didn't make anyone too worried. And as for returning to my work schedule that's something that has never left my-
-that in my life right now and I want to position my own art goals to support my long-term life goals to sustain myself.

Also to all my friends, mutuals, commissioners and followers here I'm terribly sorry about being quiet and off the grid for so long.
-raise children of my own because going through this has shown me how invaluable is it to have people you love and people that love you back as well to be able to care for you and look after you and spending that long time in isolation here has made me realize how badly I need-
rediscovering some of that passion and drive that I felt was missing in myself and my own art lately, that need to prove something and I found it again. This whole experience made me think a lot more deeply about my own life goals and how I strongly I do want to get married and-
-everything I felt numb, withdrawn and doubtful about whether or not I would pull through this time. Then when I realized I was going to make it through my sickness I felt elated and ecstatic and while I was rewatching some documentaries I saved during my stay I found myself-
Overall I'm feeling a lot better now physically, mentally though It's a bit complicated than that ultimately I'm happy because I'm feeling far more healthier now but I also feel kind of shaken up because I went through a lot of different emotions during this time to process-
And now finally I got the good news this morning that I could finally go home and now here I am! Trying my best to explain everything that happened to me last week and getting back to everyone here soon haha
Sunday I did my last CT scan, Yesterday I saw the doctor again and asked if I could go home but he said they were still looking at my hemoglobin levels and how they still seemed to be low although in all honestly I was feeling perfectly fine and just wanted to get home that day.
Although I personally would rather be where the people are and I was unable too since the WI-FI connection there is terrible and completely unreliable so that just added further to my sense of isolation. And that initial calm just led to me to get really anxious to get home soon.
-from what's been going on in the outside world and I know I have my own regular work to catch up on but there's also been something kind of interesting and nice about being being secluded away from that type of noise and just focusing solely on my own recovery.
On Saturday I knew I was already much better off than I was when I first got here and I was very eager to get back home soon, most of my time I tried to spend entertaining my mind with things I saved up on my laptop but for ever since last Wednesday I've been pretty much cut off-
I also got the news that after taking 5 Covid tests during my stay all 5 had came back negative and that was very encouraging for me to hear because during my worst state Covid was still unable to infect me at all. Which officially makes me 5-0 when it comes to avoiding Covid-19.
And by Friday evening I was feeling much better but the doctor informed me that they needed to do & look over a few tests regarding my hemoglobin levels so I had to stay here for a few more days. Around this time I was starting to feel better not just physically but mentally too.
This was actually similar to a situation I was in 11 years where I had contracted a really bad case of stomach flu and during my stay I was tested for swine flu which was happening then. Now here I am with a really bad fever and being tested for Covid, it's like poetry it rhymes.
-CT scans were concluded I heard two different conclusions that I have some type of mild pneumonia with mucus near my heart or I simply have bronchitis. either way they they gave me 3-4 vials of anti-biotics to treat it and I could actually feel the pain in my chest going away.
-destroyed after being produced because of whatever illness I had inside me so I needed a blood transfusion and they decided to not just give me one or two but FOUR in order to properly balance out everything based on their tests. The other thing was after the X-rays and-
Thurs eve - Friday morning is when they moved me to another private room for myself and that's where I started to receive proper treatment and more information of my current condition; The biggest issue was my decreasing red blood cells where all my new ones were simply being-
-if there was anything I could do for them, I would do for them and I wanted to let everyone know that and when I thought about other things like my life goals that I kept pushing towards through my art goals I felt very determined to live and push through my illness and pain.
-between what I had and what would someone with Covid had but I was felt very determined on Thursday to not let myself be marked down as another Covid statistic because in my mind I kept thinking about wanting to see my friends again and asking myself-
-and going into a dark place about what else they would find in me and of course there was the obvious question staring me in the face, did I have Covid-19? did I somehow contract Covid during last week and it started to manifest itself now? I really couldn't tell the difference-
Afterwards I was taken to a small isolated hallway of four rooms and put me in one of them, the bed was very uncomfortable and I was starting to feeling the after effects of sitting and leaning on my legs all days to manage my chest pain and I was starting to feel real worried-
-that the new area they chose to inject me with did not go into my veins at all and all that new formula just went under my skin instead which bursted a vein and caused me terrible pain and swelling on my left arm so they worked on my right arm instead properly this time.
I was unsure of what they might find inside me. And the first time they described the process to me they mentioned they were going to inject this saline formula inside me and it might cause an allergic reaction within me  but while I was thinking about that it turns out-
Around this time they took an X-ray  of me and it was the first time ever when they took me to do a CT scan and personally I've only seen it from afar but when I realized I was going under it for the first time, It felt like shit just got real for me because of my condition-
(CW) ...and when the nurses realized how my bad condition because of the blood-orange colored in my urine they and the doctors there acted fast to provide me with IV fluids to lower my heart rate and another treatment for my nausea as well-
that I was experiencing through my mask and my chest pains and I had to sit at weird angles on the chairs until I got into the beds of the emergency rooms and later I found it very difficult to walk or maintain my balance to even use the washrooms-
In addition to that I also can get Jaundice and my skin and eyes turns real yellow when this happens so this was starting to happen last week. While I was at the hospital on the first day, it was very difficult for me to breath properly because of the shortness of breath-
First off many people don't know this about me but I have Alpha-Thallesmia plus Hemoglobinapthy which basically means that I have anemia which results in the destruction of all the red blood cells in my body leading me to get fatigued and drained unless I get it treated in time-
Last week I started having a really high fever, shortness of breath and really bad chest pains that I felt was crushing or compressing my heart and it had gotten to the point where I needed to get serious help-
Hey Everyone! I'm sorry for the delay in updating you all properly but I have been in the hospital since last Wednesday & just got discharged and sent home now and I wanted to let you all know about my entire status but I was unable to do so until now. Here was me on the 1st day.
Going to have go the hospital soon, sometimes I feel like I'm getting better but most of the time I feel exhausted. I'll make another update when I can.
I'm currently dealing with a fever at the moment, I'm either too cold, too hot or too tired but I'm not coughing up anything so that's encouraging. I'll see if I can at least thumbnail some of the work I have left to do.

Here's a sketch of a wolf fighter that I did inspired by Medieval 2: Total War back around 2017-18. I used to wonder how come all the early units just have spears and where were all the swords units? haha, So this particular wolf is a militia fighter lucky enough to own one.

Here's a sketch that I did of a cat kid taking up an axe to defend his home from invaders. This started as a sketch in 2018 but I decided to fill in it and took inspiration from the peasant units in M2:TW where they're just sent to the battlefield with whatever tools they had.

Here's a sketch I did of a wolf spearman that I started around 2017-18 & finished recently. I was inspired by the "Spear Militia" unit in Medieval 2: Total War & one thing I liked about that game is that you can clearly see your unit's upgrades when they got to wear better armor.

I made one
Making better progress in this game than I expected, I already beat Jack Baker in the chainsaw rematch, then I beat his spider-wife and now I have to take on their deadbeat son and get through his traps.
Here's a sketch I did of a caracal kid who must now take up arms that I started back in 2017 and finished up recently. Also inspired by "Town Militia" in Medieval 2: Total War and I wanted to think of all the different types of townspeople that would come to their city's defense.
Why does April snow even exist? perhaps this was a lost shipment to New England :P
Went to the dentist today and got my chipped tooth repaired and replaced with a new filling as well. All went well and I'm going back next week to take care of a cavity as well.
I barely survived Papa Baker and his shovel he was kind enough to give me first aid to reattach my leg after slicing it off and I'm just now waiting in the save room LOL this is a gonna be a LONG game
I got both and I plan to scare myself this week by playing RE7 first

Here's a sketch of a wolf soldier that I did around 2017-18 but revised/finished up recently. Most medieval soldiers mainly used polearms or spears as their main weapon so I drew a bunch of anthro warriors wielding axes, halberds and the like.
First up here's a sketch of a caracal fighter that I did sometime around 2017-2018 and finished up. This was back when I was playing Medieval 2: Total War and I felt the units felt too generic so I wanted to add some variety and throw in a few anthros in the ranks haha
Sometimes I feel that I might be making you guys wait a while before seeing new finished art from me and I don't want to make you all wait too long for content while I'm working on my current queue so I'll be posting old sketches that I've found and revised in the mean time.
Also you can see more of my work on my FA and DA as well!

Hey there! I'm Santhan, a Cambodian-Canadian freelance illustrator and I like designing animal characters in fantasy and sci-fi settings. My overall goal is to create my own comic/graphic novel someday!

And I'd love to work on TTRPGS and personal commissions!
Lion's strength. Heart of gold.
Done watching it now I enjoyed it and I'm glad they adopted the spiderwolves.

I missed watching animated movies that made you feel like you were off on an adventure somewhere.
I'm watching The Croods: A New Age right now and it's the most fun I've had from a movie in a long time.
Feeling very tired of realism (mine, not anybody else's) and just wanted to do something illustrative and kind of goofy using my new fluorescent paints.

Hey guys, I'm opening for regular commissions this month to help pay for a dental operation to repair a broken filling in my tooth and I'd appreciate it if you could share this post as well. And if you're interested in getting something from me feel free to send me a DM!
Here's a sketch of a fox woodsman I did for fun! He's good at tracking and with an axe.
Went to the dentist today because I felt a tooth of mine was more sensitive than normal for a while and saw an actual dent in there and I found today I actually got a broken filling to replace & they'll do so in two weeks so I'll probably open for more commissions to fix it soon.
hi! it's my birthday and i'm 19 now!
would be happy to get a small present via retweeting my artworks :}

Forgive me if im wrong, but instead of NFTs you can literally commission an artist to create a one-of-a-kind, never seen before, 'sent ONLY to you' piece which isn't only extremely unique but also personalised to your tastes for far cheaper. All that without environmental damage.
commissioners who support the artist like this win my heart
Just wanted to make a quick update here I'll be working on commissions for about the next week or so and I'm planning to post a batch of new finished art around that time as well!
Overall I thought this was a good movie, it was fun, it felt epic, the character development is a lot better here and I think it's one of the best DCEU movies and maybe Zack Snyder's best movie too and I would rate it an 8/10.
I personally grew up watching older movies that would be like an average of 3 hours or more so I'm used and I thought the runtime here felt right because you need more time to develop everything here but I understand not everyone may have the time or patience for a 4 hour film-
all these characters which compared to the other version where I couldn't feel anything for them. There were some big scenes that I enjoyed as well that I thought were legit jawdropping moments. And for me honestly I like long movies, the longer the better & I think it's because-
for me most of them had some pretty lousy character development but here it was nice to see more time and more context for each of the main characters here especially for Cyborg and Flash which I did not expect. It also feels like there's real stakes here and I did care about-
I got around to seeing the Snydercut last night and I thought it was pretty good! I completely forgot what happened in Joss Whedon's Justice League so this felt all new to me. I thought the character development was much better here & that was my main issue with the DCEU movies-
I still have never seen the movie, Cats don't dance, but I love Sawyer's design.  She is presented as so soft and delicate.  I hope I've done her well here.
I think it's a sign, the outside is no longer my friend :P

Or maybe I should look into taking it to get fixed somewhere.
I went outside for a bike ride today along my usual route however when I wanted give space to someone walking on the sidewalk and ride around on the grass a branch got stuck in my gears and chain and snapped the whole thing off and I had to carry my bike back home-

Me and my fellow Furnal Equinox dealers/artists would have already set up our tables around this time and chat for a bit before they would all head off to their hotel rooms or even homes if they lived closed enough there while I'd be back here in Brampton waiting for the weekend.
I'm also going to see if I can get my stream back up and running again and if so I'll be offering sketch stream commission as well and will posting a link for that if/when it happens!

  Thank you very much!.

This is the sona i joined the fandom with approx 8ish years ago, finally on a proper ref sheet!.
Please remind me periodically that I am a late afternoon/evening time artist from now on.
I think moving forward, I'm going to only post my work in the late afternoon and evening times because I'm tired of barely seeing any engagement with pictures I post in the morning, I find it very demoralizing personally and I want to turn that around.

My booth in VRChat is ready to roll for #FEPixelPurrfect March 19-21st! (You don't need a headset to check it out - I don't have one!) Info on dealers, panels and events can also be found on the site & in the event Discord:

I wonder if I really should think about taking a break from painting digitally for a bit and just draw out things until the twitching is completely gone, either that or I draw with one eye closed like with an eye patch or something. It's not too terrible atm but I got concerns.
I think I'm dealing with some real eye strain right now because my left eye has been twitching a lot for the past several days now and I don't know if it's due to me working on a screen, stress, lack of sleep, too much caffeine or all of the above LOL

Hop on over and celebrate the 5th anniversary of Zootopia! : Cory Loftis, Dave Goetz

I thought Daft Punk was going to be one of those bands/acts that would last forever, got into them pretty late when I first listened to Random Access Memories and that's a great and classic album by now. Guess I'll listen to it again and feel nostalgic about good times.

Now that #ANE2021 has officially begun I just wanted to let you all know that I'm now open for regular commissions this month! and if you happen to be a resident from the New England area I'm offering a 10% discount of any commission type as well!
I'm one of the dealers here and I'll be open for commissions from now until the end of the month! I also got a special discount for any furry from the entire New England area that decides to commission me for something!
Nobody wanted or asked for this, just watch the original instead with subtitles instead.

Got approved for a dealer's table for Texas Furry Fiesta's virtual con! Along with VancouFur next month and hopefully a few more others as well I will try to make the best out of all the dealer den spots at all the virtual cons I'll be taking part in this year!
PSA on behalf of some artist peers: Get yourself a SFW ref and use it for SFW commissions. It is not common place to send pornography to a stranger and this includes your artists. It doesn't bother me but it does bother a lot of people I know. Always have a SFW ref. Please.

Didn't really draw anything new for Valentines Day so here's an old picture of my rat character Niles and his cat wife Mayflower in love. Happy Valentines Day everyone.

Here's my prediction, most of the fights will be decent except the main fight which is going to be a hugfest between Usman and Burns with a lot of pushing and footstomping from Usman with barely any punches thrown for half an hour and then Usman will declare himself the GOAT.

What is everyone’s thought on talking in fursuit?

Hubs thinks it’s “out of character” for a mascot to converse. Is it just a preference thing for suiters? Is there an inappropriate time to open your yapper? First con with Jax is coming up so I figured I’d ask the furry masses.
Sign me up capitan!
Real bold of a bunch of people with $5000+ animal costumes to be attacking a dude over “frivolous spending”. Do y’all sleep in your clown makeup or do you have to wake up at 4AM every day to start putting it on?
Here’s the third installment, I go over the wing and the exhaust. Just re-posting here to keep it all in the same thread.
Hey cutie, wanna go for a ride?

Had to cut apart and re-do the cat-back bc it hung too low. It’s much more tucked now. Also threw in a shot of the equal-length header and intake I built earlier. Fuel system all plumbed and tested too.

Tonight’s bibimbop is gonna be lit.
So update…my husband just told his team that I’m a furry and that my name is the same as the new hire.

Apparently everyone thought it was hysterical and now they plan on telling the “new” Jax that he’s gotta come up with a new nickname in their team meeting today

I kinda forgot to factor in a vacuum tube or any sort of vacuum ports for the Project Dorito intake manifold. Oops…

We fixed that with a little bit of mill work and threading, using brass fittings. Now I just need some 1/4” vacuum tube. Turned out better than I expected!

CUTE CATS ON ME COUCH
Think a furry can’t build cool stuff? Think again!

Quad ITB intake setup for a peripheral port’ed 13B. All that’s left is the easy part, welding it together
Peripheral ports are tied in, merges are cut, notched and cleaned. Probably 5 hours of work in just those four small center pipes, and had to buy a notcher from Harbor Freight lol.

We are doing a video that will go more in-depth if anyone is interested?
So far so good. I think I shut them up a little . Owner of the car is cool but his other normy friends were giving me crap so I had to flex a little .

Secondary ports are 2” (outside throttles). Primary ports and peripherals are 1.5” runners. P-ports are all that are left.
Client: “What’s that furry shit doing on your welder?!?”

Me: It’s my fursona, you still want me to build this thing for you or should I go ahead and start packing up?

Client: “Oh nonono nevermind…”
Work for the day: Lo-Fi vibes!

#FursuitFriday
The 'Furry Fandom' brings together a community with a unique hobby

A “furry” is someone who has a keen interest in, and may dress up as, anthropomorphic animals.
@ErikaAriasFOX61
 has the story.
Not for noms…only braps!

Got some new end-plates for our 9LR wing and some exciting updates on the intake fab coming soon. Learning all about rotor reversion and Helmholtz resonance is making my smol cat brain hurt
Went to Vengence Racing’s dyno night last night. Street Car Takeover is this weekend, last one in Atlanta until someone builds another 1/4 mile drag strip . Getting out of town right on time! And yes it’s in Cumming, GA lol…
Magnet off

A society grows great when old men plant trees the shade of which they know they will never sit in.

In other words…good people do things for other people. That’s it. The end.

Important to try remember that sometimes when things get complicated and the way seems uncertain.
Ah yes, right on time.
Sorry about the potato video but the noises are the best part!
#TBT to my last boosted BMW…my single turbo 335i. This thing in cool weather was insane.

Yes I know my gas gauge is going crazy and my flashers turn on. They supposed to do that .
I know everyone’s excited about sweater weather…what about boost weather??
It’s amazing the things you forget about when life gets hectic. Packing for the move and I pulled all my old paintball stuff out of the basement.

I need to see if my trusty ole’ DM12 still shoots! And then need to get my ass out on the field again sometime.
No I just Cat get enough

@wrx_dawg
Jesko forced me on the bandwagon, I swear!
After the EGT bungs we are done welding stuff to the header for Project Dorito. So we coated it to help with under hood temps. Also got a titanium sheet that we are going to make into a slick heat shield for our custom CNC aluminum intake manifold.

Both coming soon
uWu
How did you find the fandom?
Some pictures of the head from a fullsuit I finished as part of the current batch of suits I'm working on This guy has some really fun UV reactive features!
44 showings in 3 days and we are now under contract! Virginia here we come!
Broked. Thankfully not a trans issue…but still sucks!
Score!
Went by my old shop to pick up some Vibrant goodies and found a M400 in the back.
NB had to come out with something new and exciting to keep up with the new type of owners that buy C8’s lol…
Couldn’t sleep so I decided to get fluffy. Jesko joined in too .

#FursuitEveryday
DOPE BOI FRESH MOW
I GOT SNEP FORCE ONES!!

Thank you
@Miatadoge
 for the legwork on getting these, you the MVD
Making great progress on the box inspections for our move.
This sim was pretty cool…
Here’s the dome where they had the floor cave in. They marketing the crap out of that disaster! I’ll post the simulation they had of it too. Some of the cars they fixed and the others…well…check the video lol.
We had a little extra time today since we weren’t racing…so we checked out the National Corvette Museum before heading home.
Here we go
Well…we broke it. 2nd gear was acting up a lot all weekend and we finally found it’s limit. Pushing a 4400# car onto a Uhaul trailer was not fun.

Gotta love racing
We listed our house less than 36 hours ago and already have 36+ planned or completed showings this weekend.

This market is insane!! Might have it sold by the end of the weekend.
Families that mullet together, stay together.
The fab work in this car was unreal. Definitely my favorite of the event. Hopefully it runs a time that can back up the expense!
Fast bois are out of the trailers now…
They are multiplying!
He’s an older guy so I’ve been helping with shock and tire pressure adjustments. As well as showing him how to work a mobile hot spot to change his tune . He’s a boomer but it’s cool . Most runs I video in slow-mo for data but here is one of his slower runs from yesterday.
Had a couple of OK runs in qualifying yesterday but couldn’t break 10.50’s. Previous PR was 10.21, but now he has the MT radials and a new throttle, good for ahout 40whp. The car has 9’s in it but he will have to drive it very well. 1000hp with a 6sp is not easy!
I love the smell of leaded fuel in the morning
The Westin is always being left out of the Atlanta cons…BUT NOT TODAY!

#FursuitFriday
I love sitting at the back half with blower cars
Tell me you are in the southern US without actually telling me.
Without downloading any new images, what’s a “you” starter pack?
It's quite hot here. Don't cha think

@Soyori_Minimai
Met another M guy who wanted to grab some pics yesterday.

Pretty happy with my life choices
9’s or bust!

Providing a little track support for a friend’s Hellkitty as he chases a 6sp PR this weekend.  nothing breaks.
Rawr!
Huff
Take it
I plan on documenting this intake better than previous work, showing the steps it takes to build something like this.

Trickiest part imo will be the accounting for the secondary fuel rail, since the primary injectors are still on the engine.
Dorito update!

Engine builder was not happy with the way the modified lower intake flowed for the peripheral ports. It was not very well done.

That means it’s fab time! This time it’s with my favorite “medium”…aluminum .

Housing flange is being cut today. ITB’s ordered.
Ngl it’s a lot of fun to interact with kids at cons! Had one mom come up to me after her 9 yr old daughter got a pic with me and said:

“My daughter is crazy about you furries and won’t stop talking about it at home. But now that I see one in person, I want a suit!”

 = melted
It looks like I’m working with some people but if it doesn’t work out I’ll reach out to the others who responded. Thanks!
“Halo’s aren’t necessary!”
“They destroy the look!”

Sound like the same people who said HANS wasn’t necessary…to think Dale might still be alive today. Safety is paramount when you are taking the body to extremes!
I don’t really care what you call me BUT THOSE PETS THO

Take a moment to tell your family and friends you love them today.

We will #NeverForget.
Hop in, it’s a beautiful day for a cruise!
A person called OwlKitty changed the Business Card scene from “American Psycho” to the guys showing each other pictures of their cats on their phones… and it could possibly be the greatest masterpiece ever
It blows my mind the amazing patterns and markings the talented makers in this fandom can create!

Driving over this bridge is a vibe.

Little boost pull tossed in there too
Kinda surprising how big a 2 series looks compared to a 6 series from a decade ago…
Had a scary moment last night when I was blocked in by my brother’s M6. Then I remembered it’s manual too so if it breaks we can just push it!

#e64problems
My friend got some awesome shots of the M2 a few weeks ago and finally had a chance to edit them. Here’s the best ones!

No grinding for this kitty!
My teammate did a time lapse of me welding up half of the titanium intake pipe for the Dorito project…turned out pretty cool!

I had to ground the pipe through the vise so I didn’t scratch up the purple oxidation on the table. Made for some interesting torch angles
I decided I will need a secondary set for sure if I am going to do a full day of suiting.
@EZcooldown
 any help you can provide on another set of packs? I was going to go with the bigger 4 cell packs this time to see the difference!
Forgot to update yesterday…I went back inside and kept my suit on for another two hours. By 1.5 hours I was starting to notice the ice packs were losing their cool. By two hours it was time to switch them out.
Good news! The engine isn’t trashed!

Found 4 out of 6 apex seals warped, our exhaust temps were wayyy too high according to the engine builder. EGT is one sensor we didn’t have…but that’s changing this weekend.

Replaced apex seals, re-stacked, sealed, and ready for round 2.
‘Very Gay’ was a compliment, right?  #VeryGayRaptor

Didn’t want to make too much extra money so I figured I’d bring the property value down a bit with a fursuit photo-shoot. Neighbors were not pleased but oh well
Thank you
@Vanos_BunShep
 for taking the videos and never turning the recording off at the right time

I needed something to help combat the Georgia summer heat while in fursuit, and was recommended the

 vest. I also grabbed their neck wrap, and will update on how well they work if anyone is interested.

This bad boy can fit so much furry trash in it.
Taycan Turbo making me look like a base model…
13b is out…team mate is driving it 4 hours back to the engine builder to *hopefully* replace minor seals and try again. If it requires machining our season is out…and it will be replaced by something sans Doritos.
Turned out pretty cool! The sky is the limit for designs. I went with some simple stuff on these.
I think this is going to look pretty cool! Definitely good practice on keeping a steady hand…
My realtor was doing a walk through and I thought my closet door was closed…she walks into our bathroom and was like “WHAT IS THIS?!?”

Anddd now one more person knows I’m a furry…lol
The fursuit ring post got me thinking…I had some leftover 2” stainless tubing and it actually fits my paws really well without falling off easily.

But it’s a little bland so time to fire up the welder
Stickies!!
Hey I got one of those!
Lucky 7’s! I could use some luck
Welp there goes all hopes of an Atlanta Furbowl…and this was after they said we were good to go! I was just verifying dates and costs, and I get this back
I just drove to the bank and beat on it a little…and would you look at that my engine didn’t blow up.

#pistonsftw
*bonk*
Kinda nice to have your own personal groomer around…wait for the end
Racecars are dumb, rotaries are even dumber. Lost compression on both rotors after about 15 or so dyno pulls.

That’s it I’m just going to be a full time cat now. Head empty sounds like bliss.
My beautiful big bean post groom
SUSTENANCE
Made 210 whp at 8000 but it’s dropping off above that. We were hoping to see above 230 so we might be making some adjustments off the dyno and coming back for another session. It definitely has more left in it.

Still…it’s nice to have a successful day.
Yeah great make it easy for me
Thanks Georgia for this amazing heat
Getting there…
This was 6500rpm. Final tuning will be done to 10,000
Working on taking some fuel out and fixing the misfires. New set of plugs will be going in for the power runs soon. Just doing engine break-in now.
Let’s do this!!
Atlanta Furbowl-Midtown, what date?
Literally moments after this video we had an AN line separate shooting oil everywhere. Going to be a long night .

But hey at least it sounds good!
Update on Project Spinny Doritos…

Cat-back is hung and mostly done. It hangs too low so I have to cut and make some adjustments later, but it will work for the dyno.

Finishing the wiring for the Haltech tonight, set timing and hopefully on the dyno ready for tuning tomorrow!
Who’s done a fursuit wedding ring before? Thinking it might be a good idea for the cons…oh and happy #FursuitFriday!

It braps!

Open header rn so my ears are bleeding…cat-back needs some adjustments to fit.
Rotary header is now done! This ended up being very tricky with the runner length I was specified. And the fact the rear runner had to be the exact length of the front. I had two designs I ended up cutting back apart because the lengths weren’t right.

Hope it makes power!

@kittlums
I also had a pretty cool day yesterday. I got to visit the pretty much defunct Panoz Motors. I needed to cut a titanium pipe and I’ve got a bud who let me use his machines.

Those Esperante GTR-1s are sexyyy. The poor DeltaWing concept was tucked away with a layer of dust on top
I made a pleasing purple pipe with purpose.

It moves air from here

                                                 to here.
Ngl almost as excited to unbox this thing as I was when I got my fursuit

New welder get!
So Andretti’s Karting (and bowling) wasn’t cool with wearing fursuits inside the building for a furbowl. Sooo…where do we wear them? Our walkie from the car to the front door? Wtf??

It’s cool I’ll find somewhere else. Just bummed bc that place is cool
I’m-
well
Just get out of my lane already!
sliding into your #FursuitFriday like skrrt


@slatecollie
Going old-school style with the big can rear muffler. Got the under-axle pipe all cut to length, just a lot of pies to melt together now.

Stopped by my alma-mater while in town, too. Always gotta stay strapped with the suit for photo ops
OH and the oil coolers are mounted, lines made and run. To make sure the car doesn’t take 10,000 years to warm up we ran an

We had to mount it somewhere obvious bc it looks dope. Sorry for the update dump!
Let me try this cute femboi thinggg.

Andddd we have a header. Didn’t bring my TIG with me so I’ll finish this back at home.

The engine is mated and is also magically in the car now. Pretty happy I didn’t have to help with that part.
Thicc thighs save lives.

Time to build an exhaust.
Just sitting here thinking about how to celebrate #InternationalCatDay. Sleeping all day counts right? Perfect!
If you can paint a building then I guess you can paint a car?

What a good-boi for helping the fandom be relatable and showing a younger version of me there were other crazy car furs out there. Thanks buddy!
I got to be a cat at my family’s surprise party!

Very lucky kitty to have these people in my life

Has anyone ever organized a FurBowl event around Atlanta?
Soooo like how does this end up on “Adventure Travel”?? Don’t get me wrong...anything with Terah is super hot imo, but still, not the sort of thing I think people are looking for when they search travel lol.
Dealership people are savage...
This was made for me
I love making chicken katsu bc MEATHAMMER
The semi-p porting and stacking is all done! Engine is being dropped in this weekend and next week I’ll be making the exhaust out of SS and the intake out of Ti.

Excited to finally have the time while between jobs to dust off my ole’ TIG. Be ready for some feline fab content!
Spending a Monday being fuzzy with your friends is a much better day than normal...

Photodump from Limassol, Cypress…everything from leopards and tigers on ancient Roman bath floors to “DP world”! They have something for all big cats.

Oh and my cute mow magnet.

#FursuitFriday
Day 5 and we did some awesome mountain roads, Tail of the Dragon and Blue Ridge Parkway. Ended in my home of Atlanta tonight for the final party of the first “leg”. I don’t understand how people do these for 12 days straight...pic in front of the Biltmore from this morning!
When just one Aventador SVJ isn’t enough...
Gold Rush Rally, day 4! Running on like 3 hours of sleep, hence the eyelids . Next stop, Biltmore Estate in Asheville, NC! Also these carbon bodies/aero kits are super sexy
Alright fellow fuzzes! Day 3...heading out of D.C...next stop, Sulphur Springs, WV to stay at the awesome Greenbrier! We might not have the fastest car in the group...but at least we don’t have to put our car on a trickle charger so it starts the next morning
Rally-cat this week! Starting in NYC and heading to D.C. tonight...going to be an insane 5 days!!

My first ever post to DeviantART 9 years ago. I'm glad how far taking that first step has brought me so far! <3
This is a commission for my good friend Mando whose character I have wanted to draw for AGES! Glad to see you all like this too <3

Welp our race ended in a DNF after we quite literally broke the game and ended up on position 1 022 739 087 after disconnects and game crashes

At least I have art to show in just a bit!
Today's agenda includes racing in my first Bathurst 12 hour endurance in the sim AND posting some new art  Exciting!

Not that I could anyway because I don't use Spotify and the point is you shouldn't either
No I am not posting my Spotify wrapped because Spotify is a terrible company that doesn't pay artists
Reminder that N F T s are a pyramid scheme built on a system that destroys the environment
Analysis of 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs shows that the top 10% of traders have traded 97% of NFTs which definitely puts meat on the bones of the hypothesis that a lot of NFT trades are wash sales intended to artificially boost prices.

What an incredible race as a whole! Can't wait for the last 3 rounds! This championship will go down to the wire #BrazilGP
If today is to go by, Hamilton is the driver deserving of the championship. Impeccable pace from P20 in quali and a steadfast pass for the lead despite Verstappen resorting to pushing Hamilton off track #BrazilGP

Video creators can use it to get high quality slo-mo shots and competitive players can use it to nail a tricky sequence of corners to practice for a hot lap

These options benefit everyone

I'm absolutely muting this thread I will genuinely lose my mind if I see one more cryptobro in my mentions
People can talk all they want about green NFTs and PoS but as long as the majority of crypto is as destructive as it is, any party that gets on this trend is enabling and supporting a system that has no use other than generating money for the rich with an astronomical energy bill
WWF upholding it's mission of protecting the nature by... destroying it with cryptomining???

CinemaWins has made me appreciate so many movies I otherwise wouldn't. It's made me enjoy movies that are considered bad. It's even helped me with my own storytelling

As their channel description says: it's much more fun to like things than not like things
Yesterday, I watched Knives Out, a mystery thriller story I greatly enjoyed. Right after I went to watch CinemaWins' video on the movie and the amount of amazing details they picked up made me appreciate the movie more that I ever could've with just my own viewing!
I've watched a lot of YouTube on my freetime and I subscribe to channels with a broad range of different genres. It's hard to pick favourites but I just have to sing my praises to

Got a bit of an update on my bike today. It's currently in the bike shop and what a suprise; getting the specific headset replacement is hard!

We got fucked in the start, but somehow, with the amazing driving of our entire team (including me with a hangover and 5 hours of sleep) we made it from last place all the way to P12 by the end of the day

To top it all of here's me passing P12 in the last 15 minutes of the race
At least I still have the bike, tough it's unrideable until I get replacement parts. I was very mad so I decided to get completely wasted when I got home

Not the brightest of ideas because next morning I had to sit in a virtual race car for RCI's 12 hours of Donignton

Normally, I would not get stuck up on numbers, but after working on this for an entire month and being super hyped to show it off and thinking it's my best work yet, seeing it get less than 1/10:th of the likes of my most popular art uploads is a bit disheartening
Either Twitter algorithm did me really dirty or people just don't like this piece nearly as much as I do, because this post is on its way to having the least interactions of any of my finished paintings in recent memory :s

There is always danger in motorsport and everyone partaking in it accepts that risk, but this was ENTIRELY preventable if they just waited. So many of these dangerous Eau Rouge crashes were preventable with better track safety. Thankfully Norris is okay #BelgiumGP
Seb was absolutely right. They should've red flagged the session with this rain. Our commentators had barely finished questioning the race control about why they wouldn't stop the session before something happens, and then something happened. They're playing with lives #BelgiumGP
Hubert lost his life in 2019. A massive crash in Spa 24h a few weeks ago. A horrible looking pileup in W-series yesterday, and now Norris has a huge impact in the same corner. Eau Rouge is a legendary complex but they NEED to improve it's safety. This is not funny #BelgiumGP

Been working on this for a while. Hoo boy:

Today, Roblox is the most popular game in North America and Europe. It's time you knew about how it's using a generation of young, vulnerable game developers.
Obviously things tend to work out in weird ways and wishing for an ideal outcome is only that; a wish. But I've never wanted to stress about my worldbuilding so I keep believing I'll have plenty of time to finish it later
I am in no hurry with developing my world. Ideally I'll have a career in game development, maybe a 20 year run, and then retire to do occasional freelance work and focus on my own projects. Maybe then I could turn Meriterra into something tangible!
Alternatively: Riot please hire me to do character models and textures for League
Despite not being efficient enough to do comics full time, I still keep alive the idea of making a series of stories for my worldbuilding project Meriterra, with each issue covering one of my main characters and exploring the world an it's overarching plot little by little
Installing these and replacing the tyre sealant turned out to be a lot harder than I imagined

I FUCKING CALLED IT
Hamilton forced to pit and falls to last as the track is dry, and the one time George Russel was going to lead the race in a Williams his car fails I cannot believe what is happening
THIS RACE
Nice bowling game. So frustrating.
If anything, Bottas and Stroll just quaranteed we'll get some suprise podium finishers today
F1 drivers playing Forza today

Also, our one "penalty" provided with no context:
We were not last! After all the issues we drove really good stints towards the end and finished P11 of 14 GT3 cars that started 10 hours ago. I'm knackered but would definitely do this again
After our third driver swap, we suffered from a rare bug that caused our car to turn invisible on track. We had to reset and reconnect, costing us 4 laps to the leaders, so this race turned into a joyride. We're still determined to finish though!
Nicole qualified us in 6th but unfortunately we got caught up in an incident on lap 1. We caught back up to the back of the GT3 grid and now the real work begins! I'll get in the car for the first time in 2 hours

The whole point of the sprint race for F1 managment was to move quali to Friday and bring in more spectators and more money. The execs fucking boasted about it yesterday. I am getting increasingly more annoyed about their disregard for people's safety to sell tickets #BritishGP
That was suberb racing up until that point though! I don't know if you can blame either one for that incident, but one thing is for sure: This is one of those crashes that will be remembered and replayed for years #BritishGP
He's out of the car thank god. Looks really shaken up though #BritishGP
That was always going to happen. Really hope Verstappen's okay #BritishGP
This is extremely ironic considering F1 has let like 110 000 spectators in the grandstands who're quaranteed to cause these people even more work #BritishGP
The 'I' in LGBTIQA stands for intersex.  We are really common- hi, hello!   Precise stats are difficult because definitions are completely arbitrary.  But around 1% of the population is a commonly kicked around figure.  As common as redheads.

Phew it's been one hell of a two weeks, in a good way! I've been traveling withing Finland for almost 2000 kilometers, and doing all sorts of summer activities ranging from canoeing to mountain biking. Most importantly I've been able to meet friends I haven't seen in a long time!
Finnish commentator saying "Leclerc can't just pass there" after Perez pushed him off again as if you are only allowed to pass after DRS straights. Whats the point of racing if you can't try overtaking in unconventional places. I'm loving Leclerc's guts! #AustriaGP #cmoref1

Me and the boys
I have now sent out all the emails for those who got a commission slot! There was a lot of good ideas and I would've wanted to pick more, but unfortunately my time is limited before school starts again
The fact that Lewis Hamilton, F1’s first and only Black driver, has transcended the sport so much that he’s able to aggressively push for human rights and inclusivity without alienating teams and sponsors in a traditionally white, male sport? Nearly impossible, yet he’s done it.
Yes, I just let out the ugliest laugh after reading “it’s ya boy tarantula dick”
Two. Most definately two.
It's getting worse and worse by the day. They're becoming more and more emboldened.

I'll be closing the commission form in 2 hours! If you still want a change to grab a slot, be sure to fill in the form now
Oh and lastly. I think the only time I used credits was paying off Victor. I didn't even buy a car, because the racing missions were a joke, and you couldn't customize them.
I just forgot because all the character building felt simultaneously too complicated and mostly meaningless. The only thing that excited me was using my character traits in dialoque. This game could've been a just a story game without any of the roleplaying aspects
Everything outside of the story was meaningless to me. I didn't care about leveling up because the perks made little difference. All the loot was just overwhelming and I didn't install a single body mod. The only time I used crafting was the last mission when I ran out of ammo
The story wasn't as fulfilling as I expected. The game is amazingly acted, but a lot of key information was mentioned so quickly I feel I missed a lot of the context that would've made the end more meaningful. The quest log being a mess didn't help at all
I finally finished Cyberpunk 2077 and honestly all I can say is: meh

Will Halo fans look at me funny if Halo Infinite was the first Halo game I ever played #E32021

Then again I never continued Skyrim past the first hours either #E32021
Battlefield 2042 is the kind of game I'd get only if my friends played it with me #E32021
Sea of Thieves and The Pirates of Caribbean is a collaboration that has just been waiting to happen and I am all for this. And turns out I don't even need to buy it! #E32021

REDFALL looks really fun actually! I want to know more about this

...Oh. It's an Xbox exclusive #E32021

Ah, now I get it, i think. I've never played any Dark Souls games so no wonder I hadn't paid any attention to this either
I think I missed the note about Elden Ring. Why is this game such a big deal?
I will be opening commissions TOMORROW!

You'll be able to apply for all of my commission types via a form and I'll be picking multiple pieces to work on this summer!
I recorded a timelapse of this piece! The one thing you don't see here is the hour I spent posing the 3D model of her I finished earlier this year. It was a huge help with the composition and I am excited I can take advantage of my 3D skills in my workflow like this!
Shark girl summer is here and April's out practicing her surfing!

Been a while since I've done personal paintings as big as this
New art tomorrow!

And after that... commissions

I much more prefer this one over the  bad habits bingo!
Apparently staying up for 36 hours was what I needed to invent the entire history of Meriterra and write 2 pages about it into my worldbuilding document
It's 4 am and I am kinda tempted to just watch Netflix and push an all nighter
I just asked about internship possibilities from the representative of the company I was commissioned to do game assets for, and he said they've been very pleased with the work I've been doing for them!

Thats a huge fucking confidence booster!!!
I want to draw more of her
I'd love to travel. I dream of visiting countries in Asia and Africa, I'm determined to go interrailing across Europe. One of my most important bucket list items is a road trip from coast to coast in the US

But sadly I don't have those opportunities, my family never did
And to those curious the one city is Stockholm and its a day's cheap ferry trip from my granny's place so it's not much of an achievement either

Yeah I wish I was rich like all the other people in the replies having visited 20+ :')

 on Tuesday; Seb Vettel puts the team on the podium on Sunday.

Now, we can’t call it science but...

Sometimes good things happen to good people?

#IAMF1 #AstonMartin #racingpride #pride
Baku truly never disappoints! #AzerbaijanGP
HAMILTOM'S BRAKES FAILED?? PER-VET-GAS PODIUM???? #AzerbaijanGP
All things considered, a 2-3 lap sprint race to decide it all is a very Baku thing to happen #AzerbaijanGP
JEESH another tyre failure at over 300km/h. This is dangerous.

I loved Pirelli picking softer tyres for the weekend as that brings more strategy into the race but what can you do when all the teams try to still force a 1 stop and push the tyre wear over the limits #AzerbaijanGP
I reckon he has a chance to challenge for podium. He has the newest tyres of anyone in the top 10
Vettel is back!! #AzerbaijanGP
I can say that yeah I am non-binary, somewhat open towards polyamory and that my romantic desire sits somewhere in between aromantic and interested (I'm still trying to figure out that one) but thats about it
These are fun trends and I'd love to do one but I can't fit my sexuality and gender identity into two-dimensional spectrums. For a lot of people they are far more complex.
Not to mention tying asexuality into libido. Not gonna lie I know fuck all about my sexual drive because I've never actually wanted to have any but I know plenty of asexual people who have high libido.
Those terms are tied to the context of your own gender, a binary gender. As a non-binary person the only spot I could slap my little red dot on that spectrum is straight to the middle, but that would be a lie because I lean more towards femme attraction
I have seen a few different variations of these identity spectrum charts going around and I have not filled out a single one because there is a fundamental flaw in all of them. How do you define yourself as gay or straight as a non-binary person?
You don't.

punk possums are always in so here's an old commission I did for @/Punk_Bat
minecraft bee is trans
common thing I'm seeing:

person A: doesn't know what an NFT is

looks it up, reads accurate description

A: that can't be right, that sounds like complete bullshit. I must be missing something.

dear reader: you are not. it is bullshit.
My race is over and I feel like drawing so I am streaming for a bit tonight after all! https://picarto.tv/FirriApril

a sketch I did for @/ariverofstars !
Happy Pride Month everyone!
Another older painting I still love! a commission for @/AshKelling
Oh hey I could repost some old work that would prolly look a lot better with no crop now!

This was a commission for @/DustWolfPrince
New icon for Pride Month thanks to @/heresvix <3333
Playing minecraft for the third day in a row and listening to Captainsparklez songs is exactly the way I wanted to start my summer break
I would love to watch so much more indycar but the broadcast being 60% ads is just insufferable
Oh man both Indy 500 and Valorant Masters finals at the same time and I want to watch them both
Good morning to Firri and good morning to all of you!
I realized I've only ever drawn icons and bw sketches of my fursona so I made a quick reference of them!
Also yes I'm still running the stock wraith cooler on a 3900X and yes it's definately causing the CPU to run warm but I also love how it looks and don't want to change it
Did a bit of a PC upgrade today!
I got two extra exhaust fans on the empty slots on top of the case to help with CPU cooling

This was the last thing I had planned for this build so hopefully the last parts I had to purchase for the foreseeable future!
Thank you so much for the love on this! <3 I'm super happy with how this turned out and I am excited to draw more again

Speaking of that I will open public commissions for the first time in a while this summer! Keep your eyes peeled for more info soon

Man I wish muting worked on Twitter because my timeline is full of Critical Role spoilers even despite muting the hashtag xd
Good morning Europe!

Thought I'd share some of the game models I did for school this spring!

Here's a guardian character I designed and turned into a rigged PBR model
Shork gorl livery,,,
I picked up my ink pen after a long time of not practicing cursive. A bit rusty in the beginning
I've felt bad I've had so little time to draw anything or post anything new here. I've had to spend every drop of energy on school the whole spring

But now it's done for a few months, and I can't wait to start doing personal art and commissions (yes you heard right!) again!
I've been walking a very thin line between burnout and a total breakdown. We had a lot of work this spring and under normal circumstances it would be manageable but we are all so exhausted by a year of self studies and isolation. I'm just glad I finally get a break
I finally returned my final assignments for this semester

I'm gonna be honest I've never been this close to failing courses. I've always been the straight A kid who never misses a deadline so I set these high expectations for myself, but this semester has been just crueling
Retweeting April into your timeline to make up for spamming about Eurovision and motorsports all weekend
SO happy for Paretta and Simona de Silvestro - huge for them to qualify
SAINZ NORRIS BROMANCE STILL LIVES ON <3

Fuck off Netflix trying to create drama between these two #MonacoGP
Fucking murdered
That was a pretty drama filled race even though the track action was pretty much non-existent. VER-SAI-NOR is a lovely podium to see and I am really happy to see Vettel in fifth! Still gutted for Leclerc #MonacoGP
Serena Williams waving that flag like a tennis racket #MonacoGP
The only good thing to come out of all this is Sainz and Norris are P2 and P3

Just imagine if Verstappen ran into trouble #MonacoGP
Vettel passed both Gasly and Hamilton coming out of the pits? How the hell did the international broadcast miss the only track action we've had??? #MonacoGP
Why does Bottas always get the short end of the stick ughhhh #MonacoGP
OH NO BOTTAS WHAT HAPPENED?? Is the tyre bolt broken or something and they cant change his tyres??  #MonacoGP
And now we wait as the cars go around in a neat line for 2 hours #MonacoGP
FIA radio confirms Leclerc is not going to make it to the grid I can't fucking believe this

I mean I can after that impact. Itvs his mistake that cost him but can Monaco please give this man a break xd #MonacoGP
Leclerc having gearbox issues on his warm up lap noooo  #MonacoGP
Good morning we're back to regular European programming
I also just missed Eurovision
It feels nice to feel some sort of unity over enjoying the same thing with countless other people at the same time after being all alone in a tiny apartment for a year
I'm sorry about all the Eurovision tweeting I'll stop now
all of europe bopping to ukraine #eurovision
Here’s some bi panic if you’re not watching this #Eurovision
I got this vibe too but now I've found out that they literally have two games for mobile linked on their website?!! (And a character creator to order your own face sweater omg)
I STAN
I love you all
Fuck I am drunk
Let's goooo Måneskin I love you all and I am so happy for my Italian friends
FINLAND MAY NOT HAVE WON BUT ROCK STILL DID I'M SO HAPPY!!! LET'S GO ITALY!!!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
I TOLD YOU ITS BETWEEN THESE TWO
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
ITALY YESSSDDD
Italy or Switzerland wins this I'm calling it
STOP THE COUNT
FINLAND LET'S GOOOOO 218 POINTS FROM AUDIENCES
0 points lets gooo Brexit 2 electric boogaloo
OUCH UK
People votes please save us
Sweden needs to shut up
Iceland just hired some random fisherman to announce the scores I love you
Gorl you don't represent us, Italy deserved 12 points from Finland! Betrayal!
Imagine buying your way into the finals and getting 0 points

Sorry UK
EPIC SAX GUY IS BACK!!!
Italy          Finland

Appreciating Rock in Eurovision
THANK YOU ITALY FOR 10 POINTS
I wish Finland and Italy a very top 5 tonight
Okay voting closed its predictions time

If Twitter alone counted, Ukraine takes the win, but I am afraid the straights™ vote Serbia or something
LORDI!!!!
I was going to vote Italy
Okay nevermind I can't vote anyone because my operator blocks paid messages
Vote 16
I DONT KNOW WHO TO VOTE AAA
I guess the Americans wanted to take part too #SMR
Jätte bra! Thats all that comes to mind about Sweden tbh #SWE
OH FUCK YES ITALY! I love... everything! about this #ITA
This sounds like a musical and I am all for this! and I love the use of Sranan Tongo! #NED
TIX hitting us with the best look of Eurovision. King shit #NOR
Is this another one of those songs targeted for horny straight men because I don't see the appeal #AZE
France is definately the best solo performance so far! #FRA
I didn't really like Ukraine's performance in the semifinals but I have had a chance of heart. This is absolutely perfect for Eurovision! #UKR
#Eurovision without context
The Roop is so fun!! I loved their song last year, I love this almost as much #LTU
Bulgarian Billie Eilish with her new lullaby #BUL
MIDDLE FINGERS UP, EUROPE!! #Eurovision #OpenUp #Finland
The fact that they put these two songs together is sending me #Eurovision
I fucking love our entry this year #FIN
FINLAND TIME!!!
Now this ia more like the Eurovision I know! #GER
The beginning of this song reminds me of a very specific music from the soundtrack of the game Flatout from 2004

But also Moldova has some of the best beats I love this song tbh #MDA
Spain figured they'll win by just copying Netherlands' winning stage aesthetics #ESP
Okay I need to get myself some stronger alcohol. Luckily mom bought me a bottle of rum when she last visited
Iceland is so sympathetic but I think their last year's song was better ;; #ISL
I swear I've heard this same singer in Eurovision before but thats not necessarily a bad thing because his voice is incredibly beautiful #SUI
Greece's song starts out really well but falls flat midway through. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day ia ruined #GRE
I'm just waiting for a giant Toot to be let out of those trombones, deafening us all so we can move on #UK

This song has so many views in YouTube and I still don't understand why. Is everyone like, horny for the performers and my asexual brain is missing it or..?
#SRB
Black Mamba's aesthetic is a 10/10 for me but this song is not I'm so sorry #POR
This song has a really fun beat and her stage presence is something else! The personality! #MAL
Manizha is a Tajik refugee, LGBTQ+ and women’s rights advocate, advocate against domesfic violence and UN Goodwill Ambassador for refugees. She’s an absolute icon. #Eurovision #OpenUp #RUS
I have always liked Russia's entries and this is no exception!! #RUS
This is the kind of song I would 100% vibe to during a night at a bar #BEL
I like their performance and she's looking stunning but I also don't really know what to feel about them performing right now #ISR
This black and red aesthetic is making me feel things  #ALB
Opening up with a Lady Gaga impression #CYP
TIME FOR #Eurovision!!!
I'm extremely happy he got pole!! Just hoping his gerabox is okay. If they have to change it he'll get a grid penalty and I'm wishing Leclerc a very win the race tomorrow

Hamilton only P7 behind Gasly is a huge upset!
I'm not sure if I should cheer or groan

He's been absolutely on the limit in that corner all day. Pushed a bit too far this time. Conspiracy theorists will say that was intentional but he would not do that
LECLERC IN THE WALL

IRONICALLY THAT COMFIRMS POLE POSITION FOR HIM
The track look wet on turn 1 :o

I think this order will stay

Please
COME ON LECLERC!
Hamilton seems to be struggling. He was pushing like crazy on that lap and still just 6th! He has always been the driver to make miracles but I reckon he's not going to be on pole today
Ferrari is looking genuinely fast! It's been too long since they've been a real threat
Ricciardo and Hamilton looking slower than expectations in Q1. Alpine struggling is something I kinda saw coming, and Tsunoda dropping out is excused because I don't think he has ever driven in Monaco because F2 didn't race here last season
This is very unique in the sense that we have pretty much constant action on track and everyone is putting in as many timed laps as possible! Usually drivers do 2-3 runs while sitting in the pits for a long time in between
I'm banking on Ferrari succeeding today! After their impressive practice performances I took in both Leclerc and Sainz into my fantasy team. Would be amazing to see one of them on pole
It's #MonacoGP weekend! And because this is Monaco, today's qualifying is the real highlight

This track may not offer great racing action with F1 cars but seeing these cars go over 200 km/h on the narrow streets of the second smallest nation in the world is bar none
(also please keep images sfw)
Okay I've dropped my OC for a few of these but now it's my turn to rate your sonas!

I'll try be honest with my own tastes but do know a low % doesn't mean your sona isn't beautiful <3

I'll reply tomorrow
This is what’s been happening for *checks notes* the last 72 years. Israel doesn’t care about a cease fire and never has. They continue to illegally attack Palestinians in front of the entire world without any repercussions.
Lastly some new angles of her attack combo!
This may be a long shot but I am currently actively looking for a new trail bike to buy. I'm especially interested in the Canyon Spectral line and if any of you happen to know someone or somewhere I could buy one for less than €2000 hit me up  Preferrably in Finland though
Here's April's run & jump animation in 360°!
FINLAND IS IN THE FINALS! The entire live audience chanting their name before they were announced as the last spot was epic #EUROVISION
I'm going to treat you with some extra animations

Here's her walk cycle!
Here she is!

A full 360° view of April's 3D model. Extremely pleased to get this finally finished <3
I know who I'll be cheering on next weekend

Amazing to see more diverse grids!
Oh cr*ptocurrencies are plummeting?

Good. I hope they lose all their value
Well, that was going great, until I fucked it up.

Went wide in spoon corner and got a drive through penalty that cost me the entire race, just after I had caught up to the class leader and passed them during pit stops

Pretty mad with myself after that one

What this child and other Palestinians lare subjected to isn’t fair.

The cruelty of US policy that refuses to see her as worthy of saving is not fair.

The silencing and demonizing of those that do isn’t fair.

Call your Representatives, play this for them over and over again.
Over 30 children killed. Mothers dead. Hundreds injured. We are on the brink of a full-scale war. Sanctions on South Africa helped free its Black people - it’s time for sanctions on Israel to free Palestinians. Join the call. #GazaUnderAttack
I did get my car repaired just in time to get caught up in the big one on the second last lap!

You can see my golden car hit the wall at the end of that. Wrecked my suspension but managed to cross the finish line in 12th place behind the pace car

What a rollercoaster ride
How it ended

Rear ended under caution, with just 18 out of 200 laps remaining. A bit of a bitter end to what could have been a really good finishing position
How it started

I got pole in split 6 of 41. Led for most of the first hour of the race before cautions messed up my pit strategy
15 minutes until Indy AAAAA

This is what happens when employers raise wages from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour: A job "shortage" turns into a surge in job applications. It ain't complicated. There's no labor shortage in America. There's a shortage of employers willing to pay a living wage with good benefits.

Also art stream starting soon I just need to rest my hands a little after that
Now I learned that you need to wait till the end of the season to get a regular license promotion, so I need to somehow fast track my license to atleast D 4.00 in two days to be able to take part in the Indy 500

Welp I didn't want to finish my school projects anyway
Okay so, my plan with iRacing is to race in the Indy 500 this weekend

I need to get a C license for that and I have managed to upgrade mine to D 3.50 in these few days I've been familiarizing myself with the sim
as soon as this Israeli solidier who was about to throw a grenade at people saw the camera he refused.
US SPREADING AWARENESS AND SPEAKING UP HELPS MORE THAN WE THINK
At least the render still turned out nice!
2 hours of work gone. Not even recovering the autosave helped, because despite still having all my nodes right, the software wiped all my texture maps

I'm so done I am not doing that again. My bike model can stay boring and plain with no detail
I needed to add stencil textures on top of a node based material and first of all the setup needed to make that work is so volatile and breaks if you do one thing work. Then it lags like hell when painting the texture, freezing for minutes. Lastly it crashes and wipes my progress
Okay I have praised Blender and it is my favourite 3D package but holy fuck the texture paint tools are so bad. I've never been this frustrated with a software before

YESS Gasly into P10! That's my entire Fantasy team in the points
I may need to eat my words, let's see

If anything these two managed to make Barcelona exciting so that's a win!
Merc making thia interesting with an alternative strategy! I don't think it will win the race for them however
Wait? A three way battle for positions between GAS, VET and GIO in the middle sector at Barcelona? I though overtaking was illegal there
Bottas has been driving crazy good laps under our noses! Right behind Hamilton as he emerges from the pits
The race is going to be decided by how long Verstappen's tyres last. Hamilton is going for a one stop and if Verstappen can keep his tyres in prime condition he may win despite the slow pit stop
FIA radio messages on broadcast???

The most exciting thing this race tbh
Pit Game is on and Red Bull messes up Verstappen's stop!

Hamilton is prolly gonna try go long
Alright time to concentrate on drawing since absolutely nothing is going to happen before pit stops
Uh Oh Alfa Romeo not gonna be happy with Pirelli. Giovinazzi's new tyres have no pressure in them on the pits
Verstappen giving Hamilton NO RESPECT into turn 1!

These two are going to really go at it
Wishing a very please rain for today's F1 race #SpanishGP

I cannot believe this animation is from 2002. And the music, and the scenes, and the entire theme are so so good
I rewatched Spirit with my friend and I love this movie So. God. Damn. Much.
Anyway, I managed to join a Rookie Mazda race. I had never seen the track and the only practice I got was the two qualifying laps. I went on and won the race. Then I went to try oval with no oval experience and won another race. So atleast Rookies doesn't seem that bad!
When I finally got into a car I can't overstate how different driving feels compared to ACC. It's sooo floaty and it was really hard to find the limits of the car because the FFB  doesn't give you proper feeling to the road. Maybe I'm spoiled by ACC but this felt quite bland

I got a very good start and the people in front of me ran into trouble later. I don't feel like I fully deserved this but I kept very consistent on a track I really didn't feel confident on, so I'll take it!

B: Holy fuck Alucard is hot
Whoops I played Minecraft and missed the entire rest of the race

Re: creative burnout.

I spoke about this with another artist recently and figured I'd share it here in case it benefits anyone else.

For a lot of people, myself included creative burnout is not necessarily the result of a very busy schedule. It's not that you "worked too hard".

It's a bit hard to follow the overall situation though. The commentators are silent half of the time and the other half is advertisements. It's ridiculous how much advertisements there is. And there is no broadcast graphics like in F1. F1 is really the king of those
Okay the race is about to finish and the pure racing itself is really exciting to watch! Especially the onboards. These cars are so lively across this flowy track! Must be a delight to drive
Oh big carnage! Thats like, 10 cars off on lap 1
I knew they make religion a really bug thing in America but a religious service everyone is kinda forced to attend at a racing event would be downright ridiculous here, so bit of a culture shock even though I probably shouldn't be suprised
Also why is this show like, 70% ads
Wait? A pastor holding a divine service at the beginning fo the race??? Don't tell me this is a normal thing in the US
Okay turns out I am not watching GT3 tonight I'll watch indycar live for the first time instead
Material study, trying to take a form and apply a different material to it.

I included my study notes, they're more for personal use and not to be taken as fact but perhaps someone finds them useful. :)
What a race. This season is shaping up to be an amazing one

And Norris podium yess!!! #ImolaGP
and this is why Lewis Hamilton is a 7 time world champion.

Norris kept him behind for a while tho so kudos to him! #ImolaGP
Perez can't catch a break can he xd

Another one of the drivers who, despite being wicked good, has never seemed comfortable in mixed conditions #ImolaGP
ANYWAY WE ARE READY TO RACE AGAIN and I have all of the top three in my Fantasy team let's gooo!! #ImolaGP
Alonso leaving the scene hoping nobody saw him spin under yellows is extremely funny
This actually reminds me a lot of the crash I had in Imola in the Diamond Drive Cup. Same place, similar cause and effect: https://youtu.be/4U7izzhgWvg #ImolaGP
After a few replays I'm slightly leaning on that being on Russel. Bottas moves to the middle of the track to defend but still leaves enough space for Russel. Russel just wasn't ready and loses control. Not fully clear though #ImolaGP
That was huge. Both are out but Bottas sounds and looks very winded. Both mad at eachother but Russel has no business going up to Bottas and hit his helmet especially after such a hard hit
AND NOW BOTTAS #ImolaGP
HAMILTON WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOO #ImolaGP
NEVER MIND! Instantly proven wrong. I think it would've still been possible but Merc had a bad stop #ImolaGP
Hamilton is gonna jump Verstappen in the pits. That was too early #ImolaGP
I want Bottas to succeed but he is pretty disappointing today. Still stuck behind Stroll and Russell is catching up in the Williams. Then again I don't think he has ever been very good in the wet #ImolaGP
Did Norris just pass 3 cars in one move??? #ImolaGP
AAAAA and it's raining in Monza for the GT3s aswell! God I can't wait to watch this too
There goes the other Haas. That was a rookie mistake from Mick there is no way around it #ImolaGP
Can't fully blame Mazepin for that one though. Latifi left him no room after rejoining the track.

In other news what a fantastic start from Verstappen! #ImolaGP

Arrived safelly :D time to go to MFF!!!
Well! I get to say Ive been to texas!!!

... for 30 mins.
That counts, right?

Almost there now just one more flight to go :3
Having stayed the last 2 days in an airport... why is airport food so unhealthy? ;_; Why cant I buy a fruit here aaaa

I feel disgustingly unhealthy right now
8 hours to go until my flight to MFF still ;_;

Bored at the airport.

So... ask me anything? Naughty stuff is ok too. I need entretainment.
Crocodiles
Daily reminder to hug me gently at MFF cause of my broken ribs :3~

Do hug me tho. This has been the most stressful trip I ever had. Give me a hug and make me feel special!
Amen
Delays ans travelling issues already... I will take this opportunity of being about to stay 48 hours either inside a plane or waiting in airports to do something I always wanted to.

Become a Buddhist.

I will meditate the F out of this. And come out enlightened.
Feelin cute before mff lets goo
For a change, I think I'm... a-actually... with all my luggage ready to go several hours before the flight. owo!
Time to get my covid test done so i can get in the USA for mff ;_;

I hate hate hate that test. Nose rape aaaa
Some lil pics from the last shooting we did and will be posting at our OF >w>... i think its fine to share the sfw onesss here... #FursuitFriday

My feelings before travelling to a big con outside my country (which usually means at least 30 hours of travelling between flights and layoffs)

Are always a weird mixture between enormously excited and insanelly anxious / terrified.
Smol disclaimer uwu. If you see me at MFF gove me gentle hugs ;_; my ribs are still broken and I am agonizing daily!

Do hug me tho
There is room for two here... kinda ;3
H-h-hey!!! I wasnt fully dressed yet !!!
Sory I've been quiet ;-; RIbs still hurting and trying to get things figured out for MFF!!!

Excited to be about to see furssss
Of anything you can do to piss me off, I think NOTHING pisses me off more than someone treating me awfully because they're stressed out about things unrelated to me/our relationship.

It really makes me lose my mind
Aaaand home again. Went 3-0 in the tournament, so, all in all it went well. Time to rest and resume activity!
Time tontake the flights back home :"3
Tournament is over :(.

Good news: Went 3-0 and am still unbeaten and still #1 South America.

Bad news: Had an injury and had to drop out early so didnt get to win the gold again :,3
Good morning fluffy peeps

Update: Computer is ok.
It was my entire bedroom's power that exploded though. Nothing electrical works in any of the outlets.

The REAL bad news is my internet router is in my room
So Rip internet.

Also guessing i will need to get a professional for this. Rip
Guess Im having some real.bad luck. As if getting robbed by fedex wasnt enough my computer just literally blew up. On my foot. It wont work, wont even turn on. By the way, FUCKING OUCH MY TOE
Gift I made for
@Crash_Azarel
Peguei um

  na  minha mesa
They also neve called me upfront to let me know how much money I'd be expected to pay. THey literally knocked on my door with the product and a 800 Euro bill asking me to pay.
This is insane. I'm panicking.
To top it off. they're giving me only 5 DAYS. To either figure out if there has been a mistake (which they insist there isnt) or pay the whole 800 Euros, or they will -fucking discard- my product. I dont have this money right now what the fuck.
 (continue)
Making it so that the import tax I'm asked to pay to get my product is a total of 700 Euros + 100 Extra euros of some taxes that usually arent even asked if not via fedex.

They're demanding me to pay 800 Euros of taxes for a product that its worth less than 400.
(continue)
Dont ever use Fedex.
I purchased a product of 400 euros, with 100 euros shipping.
The swords arrived here with Fedex claiming that the shipping cost had been 540 Euros (??) And thats adding to the 60% import tax of Brazil. (continue)
Guess im getting sick from the second vaccine shot :(

Looking forward to getting more leggy again and showing progress!
Tomorrow onwards its a big step for me.
I'll be stepping down from my anti-depression/anxiety medication that I was prescribed.

Starting by reducing the dosage, bit scary, I'm afraid of going back to where I was before, but I'm in a much better place now and I think I will win!
Butt workout day uwu lets go.

And its kinda feelsbad if because I trusted that everyone would do honest posts, I end up putting someone that is bad in my video by accident.

I dont keep track of all dramas and stuff on the fandom to always kmow who has bad reps :'3
Please, try not to do troll fursuit posts when I make tweets where I let people choose which fursuits I will talk about on my next video :(

I pick the fursuits at random to give everyone a fair chance and exposure, instead of just picking popfurs or something. XwX
I will be re-editing and reposting the   video soon...
Apparently I got trolled :(.
Had to take down my latest video because among the fursuits suggested, someone posted a carpet fursuit that I didnt know had a creepy/bad rep In the fandom.

Because I chose the fursuits and matched them randomly, that fursuit ended up in the vid.
Good morning flufferinos!

CW// Weight loss, dieting, ED

I was in denial for years that I was binging food due to mental health. I was so unhappy with myself but unwilling to give up the ~3,500 cals/day I was eating. Until 2 years ago I bit the bullet and changed my life. It was hard, but I'm happier now!
Mmm... got hit on my arm pretty bad sparring yesterday.

Tell me furry stereotypes, and I will make a video talking about them and which of these stereotypes i actually am part of.
Just found out about Maple, the cute doggo from the youtube channel AcousticTrench has passed away.

I knew not Maple, but their videos always helped me sleep in anxious nights.

Coincidentially also got my new guitar repaired and will play a song for Maple

Rest well, loved one!

This little hummingbird got trapped in my house today!

I think I can say that I'm 100% over that coughing from covid. I think I didnt cough today at all !!!
I have come to a conclusion:
Mozzarella is the best type of cheese.
NO one can switch between wanting to be pet by someone and wanting to bite that same person as quickly as I can.

Sorry for not making videos or anything in a whiiiiiiiile.
Covid has been holding me down big time, hard to bring up the usual excitment and jumpiness with all the coughing
Talk about role inversion!

I really need to go to Italy someday.
I've come to realise that, 3 of my 5 favorite meals are Italian.
Aswell as my favorite dessert.
I want a hiking buddy
Why is my coughing coming baaaaaaack i though this was oveeerrrr
Weh
I hate how many symptoms of my reflux overlap with covid >_> Like the constant coughing and chest pain... It gets scary sometimes
I think I'm almost 100% recovered from Covid :) Hell yeh!
Good morning furry world!
In today's episode of "where my covid nostalgia brought me" lemme share a good memory with
@PurpleM8n
I have gotten fairly addicted to listening to relaxing lofi stuff while working or doing stressful stuff and sleeping uwu. I confess its been helping cope with anxiety
Imagine spending all sunday long working to make your boss richer while you're barelly being paid >_>...
OH WELL.
Cough comes and gooooes ugh -3-
After 6 hours procastinating I finished my first surprise edit fursuit, with
@Crash_Azarel
 and also
@PurpleM8n
 I hope you like it (it's just a simple test)

I don't know if the translator will get it right (my English isn't even 10% ;-;)
#fursuitfriday have pawbs
I need to chill big time xP.
So many bad things health wise happened to me and important peoplenclose to menlarelly that Ive grown too paranoid.

Too afraid of the future to enjoy the good present times...

Chill Crash, ffs.
I cant wait for this coughing to stoooop

So much coughing x_x Uggggh.
This is annoying
My mom brought me some hot tea to help me with my coughing.

And she brought it to me in this mug.

I am almost crying. For those who dont know, my entire lide me and my mom have had issues with me being a furry. BIG issues. This is a big deal for me.
Remember that time I got saved by a jojo-like sergal ?
Me neither, but guess it happened! :D
Covid is such a weird one...
Sometimes youre fine all day then you have some random symptoms for a night and wake up like nothinf have happened the day after, onlt to find some new different symptoms later on.
It really is a box of surprises.
For people I'm still owing comissions !!!
I'm srory for the delay. Between issues with my tablet, my computer needing to have windows re-installed and other misfortunes that kinda just happened, I am indeed a bit off schedule.
I'm getting back to finishing them today tho!
Thanks
I listen to early 2000-2010s music for nostalgia so much
Eep eep! Happy fursuit friday! Lemme do the hearty hearty crash dance for you! #FursuitFriday
That covid test that goes through your nostrils made me feel so violated x_x... never bled so much from my nose

Art awesome by @CWolf567
Random thought: If youre like me that is super picky with your clothes and end up only actually wearing a small percentage of the clothes you have... donate the rest. I just realised how many of my clothes I rarelly wear... someone out there is wearing rags...
Just found this twitter

Q: Crash, where did you get your name from?
A:
Hey
@Crash_Azarel
  I'm your worst pizza fiend! ^^
Many thanks for
@RhunenStaldrad
 for making this.
Many things. One of them being the fact I would climb my school's walls when I was late, hide in the bathroom and then sneak to the classroom so the staff at the door wouldnt pick me for being late.
After months stuck on the mail... my new sword has arrived. From Sigi forge, my dear "Freeway". Named after the best dog of all time. Miss you buddy <3
Leg up cute pose achieved!!!

A good boy.
Question: If Crash was a vocalist at a band. Which vocalist you think his voice would sound like?
During quarantine I find myself thinking about good ''old'' times a lot. These thoughts range from great experiences likes Cons I've been to, up to little things of the past that I didnt vallue as much back then.
I kinda miss when I was a younger, just starting furry too...
Aproveite seu verão com o Crash!

Hey,
@Crash_Azarel
! U jelly?
Its pretty crazy how bad it is when you're not mentally well.

Every single day is like a little battle you gotta face or a coin you gotta flip to find out if you'll be freaking out and down at the end of the day, or actually kinda ok.

Can't say its boring, but it sure aint fun
What is the first thing you're gonna do when the quarantine is over ?

For me is go for a walk with
@PurpleM8n
 , have some ice cream and chill at a park.
When you're clearly the tallest of the squad and you gotta bend over to line up.
Cause I'm so tall.

Good morning everyone, hope you're all safe !
For anyone that may have received said Dispute, (Paypal shows 6 disputes.) these are NOT intentional, and are but mistakes.

Do not worry, as I already contacted both Paypal aswell as my Bank to request the cancellation of those disputes.

I'm really really sorry for this.
Just what I needed:
Paypal/My bank being stupid.

Recently there was a purchase on my Paypal that I do not Acknowledge, I contacted by bank to request a dispute and instead of Paypal disputing just that single purchase, they disputed pretty much all my purchases of the past month
Oof. oof. Good morning furries <3
Quarantine's been rough. Specially missing spending time with my dear

Until she saw what it came from. Lol
Proud to say I got invited to be guest of honor at a national Hema and Fencing event to talk about longsword and comletitive duelling!!! Aside from Furries, HEMA is defnelty my main hobby and its rewarding to know I conquered this kind of recognition!!!

"You're never gone. You're just less orderly"
I dont usually share stuff like this. But this really moved me, one of the most reassuring and comforting ways of describing the phenomenom of death, and how to cope with it, and it can be heard and understood regardless of religion and personal beliefs.

Narrow glass lets you get *really* close to the subject, and 24mm means having a crazy-wide field of view for a macro.

Just a typical Saturday night
@chili_dogg
She’s saying it with her chest now
At Night
Learning HTML Basics on a whim and it’s making my brain think! I kinda like this :3 It’s like creating stuff
Vibing 22
I was debating on getting out I didn’t get the orders I wanted and be a contractor. But I guess things happen and maybe do one more contract with the Navy and then get out :3
I can’t wait to experience Sea Duty and move to a new unexplored area! And hopefully say hey to some peeps :3
After stressing for months on orders for work to see where I move to next or even considering a change of careers. I got orders to Whidbey Island, WA! It’s gonna be my first time moving to the West Coast! I’m excited but really nervous! Don’t know when I’m leaving exactly but—
Yeeeee thank you so much! I appreciate it lots! I loves it
I just realized my hair going SWOOP
I guess getting coffee is selfie time material
TEGGY TYPE R  I wonder if it’s a legit one! Either way that’s DOPE!
Hope y’all’s Monday goes awesome! Hopefully doesn’t go like a typical Monday
Had an awesome weekend hanging out with  friends :3 Having a weekend to vibe and go on adventures makes waking up for work in the morning not so bad :3
DC not D.C whoops XD
We vibing and ready for adventures in D.C :3
Went to the mountains today with some good pals
I’ve never seen this Dodge before and I’m curious what it is

Deadass just woke up to building maintenance barging in to work on my shower. He goes good morning and is that a Halloween costume? My half awake response. “Yes” :3
Taking pics that day kinda started a spark that I’ve haven’t had in awhile! It was definitely a blast for me to learn on spot!
I honestly had a blast using a good camera for the first time in forever :3 Makes me want to get my own soon! Maybe :3

Thank ya again
@ChatahSpots
 for letting me use your camera and being patient with me learning it xD
I blame working night check hours
During the day I have like no energy. But late at night I’m blasting music and dancing in my room

Why
It’s those hours :3
@KaizerWolf_AD
Honestly just slide me coffee and I’ll be the happiest wolf around
Don’t worry I just be vibing! :3
Through a window. Wanting coffee!


@TalesTigerfox

A con I will never forget
Finally just got home! I can’t describe how much BLFC was good to me! All the good vibes! Meeting so many new friends and seeing so many familiar faces :3 I can never forget the con and all the good energies. Can’t wait to see y’all again
Dear furries,
Please learn some fucking conflict resolution and talk to your friend if they're doing something wrong and give them a chance to improve before blasting their whole ass on twitter. A lot more can be resolved this way. Do better to your friends.
Walking out of your room into the hallway. And then having memories of the con flashing back in your head. Just puts you right in the feels

But it’s not goodbye. It’s see ya later
Here's
@KaizerWolf13

Interesting Monday if I say so myself

Co worker came in clutch
I just realized it’s #NationalCoffeeDay

I haven’t had my coffee yet
Shiny teeth shiny teeth
I feel like I waste the entire day sleeping in until work xD
Waking up 30mins before work to go in at 3:30pm sucks! Then repeating that daily until the weekend. I need to fix my sleep schedule to wake up at like 10am or something!

When taking my advancement exam I swear this bug kept flying on to my paper. I wanted to smack the table so bad but in a quiet room everyone would be like.


The I need caffeination vibe
HODDIE
Honda sounds

Prelude is back better then ever
3:00AM Parking Lot Jam
Having a sheppy boyfriend can be quite tasking, as he requires daily belly rubs to stay happy~
Can’t wait to throw this little prelude on the track :3
She tuned and running healthy again
“I got the magic laptop” xD Now he’s gonna tune it and hopefully see what she makes on the dyno :3
Of course when I dropped it off the battery died so I went to go get a battery. By the time I went to go get one. The tuner messed with ignition timing.

I got back and then put the battery in. And it started right up and ran a HELL of a lot better xD He saw my face and goes
Just dropped off the Prelude with the tuner!  She gonna be tuned and running better then ever
I thought that poster was real for a second xD
I honestly don’t remember who took this photo
Tacos on a Friday doesn’t sound bad at all  #FursuitFriday
Trying to tow the aircraft to the taxiway at work but it wants to be sassy

Love this
Glad he didn’t look at my phone either when I left it on the desk xD
The funny thing is to. Is when he was like “there is always one furry at every command”. “And I will find them”
Literally QA at work decides to randomly walk in my shop and ask everyone “what is your fursona”?  Out of no where!

Me in the corner
If anyone has space for Riley at BLFC! That would be awesome! If ya can of course! :D
When I’m in a drive thru with my windows down and a Cicada decides to say “HELLO” and fly in and almost flew into my face multiple times!

Never been so close to drop my coffee
The Dunkin Coffee is acquired
Sleeping for 12hrs to catch up on sleep feels so nice

But now it’s coffee time

Work today was an experience! Got to participate in a fly over with my squadron in a Heilo and got to be on the field at Penn State! Definitely an experience!
Take a moment to tell your family and friends you love them today.

We will #NeverForget.

Where do I start? I can’t thank everyone on the West Coast enough for the amazing hospitality and being so awesome! For taking me to explore Vegas and Cali! Thank you all for the memories that y’all made for me! I can only post 4 pics and that doesn’t even do justice :3

That weird, cosy, & melancholic feeling of being "happy-sad"
Thank you everyone for the support and the advice on this :3

It means a lot to me! And I know I can do it! One month vape free here I come
Like I went from 175lbs not too long ago and now weighing in at 155lbs. It kind of scared me not gonna lie because I didn’t even work out. And boom weight loss. But in a very quick and peculiar amount of time.
Ya know what. I think today is the day where I quit vaping cold turkey. I feel like vaping controlled my day from waking up till I fell asleep. I feel like it also had some play in my random weight loss and loss of appetite. It’s quitting time
Taste of Autumn

So what’s up I’m Kaizer


@ChatahSpots
The pure hype for the song
The song that lives in my head

“I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time!”
I feel so dumb trying to put together my harness xD

I’m like oooo I want to put it on. Then I try figuring it out. Then! NOPE can’t get it xD
I just realized I have a shave cut
Fursona Vs Owner
Every time I eat Taco Bell

So trying to register the Honda Prelude after so long and the package was delivered but I never got it. And it’s no where to be found so I guess it’s stolen/lost. It sucks because it had my title, tag, and really important paperwork. Now I’m jumping through hoops. But WHY ;-;
I always like finding clothing that fits Kaizer right :3 any suggestions that you think would be awesome :3
Hoodie and a scarf in Fursuit hits different :3

Vibing in Just Chatting before we get into the spooks in Phasmophobia :3
This is the main reason why I stream with my face cam on. I don’t want people just to know me by my model. But I want people to know who I really am. And it’s sad when someone mentions to me. “Oh you should try VSeeFace because it’s cute”.

Having a concert in your car is probably one  of my favorite things to let the stress out. Just you. Your music. And just a vibe
Reach out to someone you haven’t talked to in a long time and let ‘em know you still care about and think about them. Could make their day, you never know.

Question for y’all! So my new room has a pretty bad echo for when I stream. Should I just get the sound proofing stuff for the walls? Or is there another option?
Barista: The person in front paid for ya. There a chain reaction going on! What to continue it?

Me: Pfff to course :3

Glad to be apart to spread them good vibes.
Hey twitch chat, can we NOT go into other people's streams and say things like "this chat is dead compared to Beta's"!

That's EXTREMELY DISRESPECTFUL and God help me if I found out you did something like that from MY streams.
Tommorw is the day for my wings board at work! After that is out of the way! It’s back to streaming :3

Already posted this pic once but I thought it was a nice touch
If you don’t already know#ScrewTheCrew


@ChatahSpots
Don't feel invalid if you still love your DHC suit. You spent your time saving for it and you wanted that specific style for your character to come to life. You could not entail what was to come. Non-promotion of the company is a good start.  Don't feel like you have to get rid
Nahhh bye
https://twitter.com/i/lists/1225369281971486720…

Found the list!
Same. Love my fursuit but the makers god dam... They’re ridiculous and I’m just disgusted.
I have been sent a Cease and Desist from DontHugCacti over this tweet.

I stand with the victims and have done nothing wrong.
I need to hire an attorney to defend myself, but cannot afford this on my own.

Friendly reminder to ask before hugging people at MFF. Just because the majority of us will be vaccinated/boosted doesn’t mean we’re are automatically comfortable.

Also if you’re having claustrophobia/social anxiety don’t forget to take a break and step outside for fresh air!
Damn i love this Fandom.

So… what does “furry” mean to you?

For me, it’s an all-encompassing word. Anthropomorphism, cartoons, mascots, fursuits, art.

In over 3 decades of being a “furry,” it is what some call it. It’s a label.

We’ve been called many things, but the meaning has stayed the same.
ALREADY REGISTERED #MFF2021
We have arrived at MFF!!
We are waiting in the vaccine wristband line already x3
The trip has begun!
I see someone decided to crash MFF
...
I'm buying and bringing a cheese grater.
I think I'm all packed up!
Now, a good night's rest before dropping off a bill, grabbing some supplies, then making the trip to MFF!
Most chores are now done around the house.
Waiting on laundry.
Then It's time to pack and get ready for bed!
Shit.. I'm not gonna sleep tonight am I.
Better try to wear myself out x3

Any friends looking to party that night?
I have 3 friends looking for room space for MFF, anyone got space?
Ok now I’m putting out an emergency call about getting a place to sleep at MFF. I’m clean, only carry one bag, and will sleep anywhere and stay out of people’s way. Please let me know if there is anywhere that I could stay
MFF is in two days!

Happy Thanksgiving!

Have a wonderful day!
I wanna be a VA so bad.
In regards to the Arizona Tea thing.
Yes, my boycott of their product won't hurt their bottom line individually.
But ya know, if like a million of us did it. Then that means they lose literally millions in revenue and maybe it makes a change?
Blizzard's being DDoS'd right now.
Fuck em.
Ok. Mr. Beast literally recreated Squid Games and its so worth a watch.
NFT's are awful.
We need to stand in union against companies that decide they wanna invest in bullshit.
No more Arizona tea fam.
I refuse to work for any company that cuts the pay of remote workers.
Federal Investigation for hate crime starts in February next year.
That will be interesting to see what their personal lives will tell and if it was racially motivated.
All three men that were involved in the Ahmaud Arbery case have been charged with murder as well as multiple other accounts.
Our justice system got this one right.
May his family find some peace now.
Sinema is a problem and needs to be replaced.
Let me pose a question:
If a random person came up to you and said they'd pay for you to go to space, would you say no?
They are only willing to cover your trip and if you say no, they just keep their money.
Do you still say no?
Hell no. You take the trip and live it up!
I now celebrate this.
Happy Wolfenoot!
Taking advantage of the opportunities given to you by the circumstances of who birthed and fathered you shouldn't be looked at so negatively.
You dont get to choose who you are born by.
Why not make the best of it?
The more desperate they get, the more obvious it becomes that your statement is getting through to them.

Words cannot express how amazing this is.
But all in all... I was able to have fun with it.
I doubt I'd ever rewatch it, let alone, again and again like I have the anime.
My take from EP1 of the live action Cowboy Bebop...
The actor for Spike does not portray the the character well.
Faye Valentine's character seems to feel completely different and I think they miscast Faye terribly.
The fighting is atrocious. Its laughably bad.
They beat his ass as a family
INTRODUCING LOW-POLY SHIA
Hey all. Jack and I have tested positive for COVID-19. We have most likely gotten this virus from BLFC. We do not think it was furries, but the normies that weren't vaccinated that could've infected us

A short  on my relationship with my boo:

It might just look like we’re the perfect couple and everything is roses and peachy all day.

On social media we often only portray the good and cute side, in reality our relationship is like anyone else’s.
Streaming at 1080p 60, causing viewers with lower end internet to not be able to watch.
Im an affiliate. Last night, twitch only gave source option. I have not changed my stream settings in like a year.
I don't only "stream to the rich" who can afford good internet.
This happened in my stream last night.
If you think a streamer has done something you don't like,  do not attack them with your accusations. You need to know what you are talking about first.
Smh.

The Rittenhouse new legal murder precedence.
Let's talk about that.
Should I do it? Debatable.
Am I going live in 20 minutes to talk about the terrible and dangerous Precedence the Rittenhouse case just established on Twitch?
Yup.
Swing on by if you wanna hear my take and then have a long talk about it after.

Bruh. Have you seen the work?!! It's insane it's only 700$
The quality and detail of the models it's remarkable.

If you can't afford that quality you aren't ready to commit to that quality.

Remember to report and mute/block zoophile accounts.
No need to reply to them. They won't listen.
Anyone can get a booster in the US now! Please go get it if you haven't done so already, especially if you are planning on attending any large events!
Does this mean protesters can open carry in defense of anti protester agitation for self defense purposes?
So, sadly I'm out $200 for something stupid...I don't wanna talk about.

So commissions are open again since I've killed down my queue a lot.

RTs appreciated!
The “it’s just a joke” argument is so stale. Sure joking around is fine but empathy has to play a role in that. An offensive joke will still be offensive to someone. The “satire” argument is also overused and some of y’all need to actually look up the definition.
Get ready for the Rittenhouse tour.
He will 100% be on Carlson, Crowder, Shapiro, and probably even Rogen.
He'll probably never work another day of his life. He's probably already working with a ghost writer for a book.
Absolutely disappointed in how that trial was conducted.
It was an absolute shitshow.
I'm not surprised by the verdict. Extremely disappointed.

Since like 40% of our country doesn't want to vaccinate, vaccinations are just sitting and dying.
Go get the booster. Lie and say you work front line.
You aren't "taking away" a dose from anyone or those at higher risk like when the vaccine came out

Booster/flu shot is kicking my ass.
Wooof woof.
I hate that I can't just give guys compliments without someone assuming I'm gay.

I'm not gay just for telling a dude they look sexy in that suit and tie today.

Normalize complimenting your guy friends
Not gonna lie...
I have been quite surprised to see how many 29-30+ members of the fandom that participated in the trend!
The Fandom really seems young at times and seeing this makes me feel less alone!

So alot of peeps call my Amy or Omi but the proper way to pronounce my name is this:

Take the "My" out of the word Miami and that's how Ammy is pronounced.

Hope that helps!
Guess I gotta say Fuck one of my all time favorite directors and writers.

compare it to the US price

The US pharmacutical companies overcharge EVERYTHING

honestly im surprised the flu jab is so cheap
oh yeah my new merch shop just went live too - check it out (if you want)
Also... Why the fuck is the flu shot $40+ without insurance?
How is it that expensive?!
Hey cats, you wanna explain?

I'm not a perfect person but you're damn right I try to learn and grow from mistakes.
Thats how they become lessons instead of being regrets.
If you really care,
@itsnightzy
, explain to us why you actually made those insulting posts in the first place.
Own up to why you decided to be hateful.
Then maybe we can work on an actual apology.

Anxiety doesn't cause someone to post insults and hateful comments to a thread they had no reason to be commenting on.
The could've just left it alone.
Nope, had to go ahead and be an asshole.
Then make a fake ass apology to DM that they then later publicly post.
Its just gross.
I don't think they deserve to be cancelled.
But They sure as hell need to know what they did was wrong and actually acknowledge it instead of hiding behind a bullshit excuse.
I'd rather them see the err in their actions and ways and grow from this.
But its not looking good.
@/itsnightzy made some extremely rude and insulting comments.
They then made private DM apologies only to post the same apology publicly to try and curb the well deserved criticism they were getting.
They don't actually care, they just want the heat off their back.

Everyone is dunking on this every which way so I'll just make the point again that if you have to MAKE the yellow star YOURSELF and put it on YOURSELF you have already completely undermined whatever shitty point you think you were making

People realized that they are undervalued and the work place is shit.
People are good at dealing with 'shitty jobs' they quit management or awful work place environment.
This is sick behavior from Rep. Paul Gosar. He tweeted out the video showing him killing Rep. Ocasio-Cortez from both his official account and personal account. In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired.

I want y'all to remember that DADT existed until 2011. Ten years later, I'm a commissioned LT and both my superiors and subordinate officers are upset my husband isn't here.

I've had no less than five people ask about him, then follow up unprompted with "Is he ok?". Go Navy ^^

Totally not worth $8.
Today's #BLFC2021 Selfie is with the amazing Doryuu!
It took almost 3 years for us to be at the same con BUT IT FINALLY HAPPENED!
It was so freaking amazing getting to see you in person and getting a few moments to vibe at such a crazy con!
People can spend money on whatever they want.
I just dont think the person offering "those benefits" should be charging like that.
Its so... gross.
Covid sucks :(
Everything hurts and it’s hard to breathe. The 9 year old is showing symptoms now too.

New streamers: please, please, PLEASE do yourselves a favor and talk as much as you can during your streams, even if you feel or KNOW that nobody is watching. You'd be surprised how many lurkers will break their silence to carry on a conversation with you!
I exist in two forms:
basketball shorts and shirtless/tshirt

Damn cons can really take it out of ya~
Such a great time though.

It was such a long trip back and so much had to be done all the way up until this moment...

Well.. That was about 12 hours of sleep x3
Yup I know that feeling almost all my friends are 13-14 hours behind me so yeah can be hard
This is why I hate answering random telegram DMs. Granted I’m sure it’s some child trying to be edgy but yeah don’t do this. So this person might try to impersonate me so please block.
Holy shit is there so much to unpack from BLFC...
And I'm not talking about luggage.
I will not be making that trip to BLFC like that again.
I'll fly to Denver next time x3

You know what sticker is really funny rn?
Wow what a weekend! Met lots of amazing people, ran around as a giant fluffy husky, took a bunch of pictures, oooh.. and of course made some amazing memories I'll hold close to my heart. I seriously had an amazing time at BLFC this year and I absolutely look forward to next time!
I will never stop campaigning for people of all genders to be able to dress and look he they want without persecution.

Clothing and makeup are not gender specific!
So many furries in one flight. Tag them if you know them!
Okay but I haven’t seen as many hot guys before in my whole life as I did this weekend at BLFC, it was really confusing for this poor deer! The hot tub was absolutely crazy one night  everyone had either a swimmers body or muscle body!
To clear up misinformation.
The RV was not stolen.
In the moment a lot of us didn't know what exactly what was going on.
It was moved off site due to the trespass ban on John because he now needed to use the RV as a room.
RV stuff was cleared up and we’re all good. Heading back to Colorado.
I been waiting all my furry life for a furry rock show. Thank you Nervous Vulpis <3
Nervous Valpis were amazing as shit last night!

Good bye Reno, its been real!
This was such an amazing and fun con. The hotel was awesome other than being a bit hot in the con spaces. #BLFC2021 was very well ran and organized.
Props to all volunteers!
I definitely want to find my way back next year!!
Bad lighting lol.
For all who are talking about BLFC.
Read this.
Good night twitter.
BLFC was amazing.
Was a pleasure meeting you
@solisthewolf
I deleted every tweet made by me involving the pizza.
I had nothing to do with it.
I was not involved with it.
I was originally just trying to stop misinformation from being spread but it became more than that.
When im home, I'll take time to explain everything correctly.
I think I'm going to step away from Twitter.
Its finally became too much.
This is great advice! :)
Also a good rule to follow is 621
6 hours of sleep
2 meals
1 shower
Is another good one :3
Relaxing and letting my body settle a bit in my room before getting out there again!
First an earthquake... now there's a lemon on the roof. WHAT IS HAPPENING
Just had my first Korean BBQ experience!
It was so tasty and good!
I love Green Tea Ice Cream!!
Wasn't able to tag all who were along for the ride but I appreciate yall being there and having a great time!
Anyone want to have a drink at the crystal lounge?

Tonight was such an amazing night.
So much talent tonight at the dance comp - I’m so proud of all of you  was a dream come true getting back on that stage, I’m reminded how much I LOVE performing. It was a pleasure meeting the dancers backstage, and of course congrats to those who placed! Well deserved
With the #MFF drama sparking back up. I feel the need to retweet this old poll I did.
What are people up to tonight a @ BLFC?
Hit me up mutuals!

I started nursing school again and will be finishing that up full time now ^^
Commissions will still happen from time to time! And maybe a shirt! But no more cons.
How it is playing red dead with

Great way to say hi if you haven't ran into me yet!
Alright, breakfast time.
Got to see and hang with some of my favorite people ever! #BLFC21
I was dancing up on stage with a few furs and was unable to hear the name of one due to how loud it was.
Hopefully they see this!
Absolutely exhausted and wouldn't have it any other way

I feel lighter lol
Haircut time

I'm just going to leave this here
I'm not one to usually watch series or movies without English Dub...
But if you didn't watch Squid Game with its original audio, you did yourself a disservice.
guess there isnt gon be a season 2
King of the Hill once again confirmed for best anime.
Yes I wanna talk about Squid Game with everyone.
Have small organizations with almost no PR collected as much or most plastic than this from the SAME AREA OF THE OCEAN? And without bycatch? Yes, yes they have…
Hopefully the investigation will find that no trial is needed and to let the Reporter be.
This is what the problem is. Technology has advanced so fast that our lawmakers don't know shit about it.
They need literal TECHNICAL advisers.
Watch the Facebook trials and stuff.
Its just.. dumbfounding.
LOL Just got a twitter report about a Zoophile account that I had reported...
They gone~
the one being punished for leaving a game.
Just had an unrated match where the other 4 members of my team were premade and they surrounded me the first 3 rounds and proceeded to kill me with Sova Shock Darts and Phoenix Molly.
@PlayVALORANT
 You need to do something.
My only choice was to report and leave and now i'm

 GothicDesire and Richard!
When I get my car back, I'll probably have to stop streaming.
I'll need to make some hard cash and work my ass off until I leave for BLFC.
I really enjoyed Train to Busan except for the 3rd act.
Unfortunately, It fell into some awful zombie movie tropes after being so unique and exciting for the first 2 acts.
Still a great movie.
I still don't have my car.

Faux Fur Tip:

Slowly increase the temperature on a blow dryer (avoid overheating)  with your faux fur on a flat surface and repair creases and lines in the fabric.

Have any of you tried this before?

What ideas/milestones would y'all like to see?
I need suggestions!
I love this look x3
Its so good !!!
The verdict is not good at this point in time.
Still figuring it all out.. but most likely gonna have to give up BLFC..
Just blew out my tire.
No spare or donut in the new car.
This means a tow. 125$
Tire is going to be at least 100$
Hoping that I didnt do rim damage.

Might have to cancel BLFC.
Thank you so much!!! Its soooo gooood!
(Also, I absolutely love your stuff. Havent caught your livestream much but have loved your runs for GDQ)
So I'm going to be setting up pre-orders for a merch item and since it's my first time... I have no clue what I should do!

You're welcome. ^^
It even has a album title!

@SkyeCabbit
#tattoo apparently it didn't post when I originally tried to post it
@Impulsive_Mez
On another note... It looks like they filmed the ICONIC scene in Resident Evil 1 that shows the first zombie!
That's pretty cool.
Resident Evil has some EXTREMELY specific events and lore....
I hope they don't fuck this up.
I'm setting my expectations extremely low.

Why are people upset about the big twitch streamers pay outs?
They put time and effort in to build their platform.
Their content is free.
The people decide where they spend their hard earned money.
They chose that streamer.
Another school shooting.
Reports suggest that a fight broke out between two students. One pulled a gun and wounded 4 people.
Hoping everything is going to be ok for the victims.
That said, you should enable two factor authentication (already required before you can start broadcasting-- good policy) so your password alone isn't enough to get into your account. https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/two-factor-authentication?language=en_US…
I think attacking streamers that make a lot of money is pointless

We should be boding Twitch, since they don't really do anything to help smaller streamers get started, it's literally dog eat dog until you hit a certain breakpoint

a main takeaway should be that Amazon started a program to exchange one Twitch emote per user for over 2 million users' full legal tax information, then spent zero effort on securing that information
Hi my name is Comet and I’m looking for someone to give me a home. I like stargazing, going to conventions and outings, snuggles, long walks in the moonlight and what ever you would like to do together

So there will be no Stardew Valley tonight due to our lovely friend, @/JiMala_BC, not feeling well!
Please wish them well and hope they start feeling better.
But that begs the question, what do the wolf do tonight?!
PSA TO ALL STREAMERS AND USERS OF TWITCH:

There has been a massive leak of just about everything in Twitch's databases, so I highly recommend changing your passwords - change your stream keys, enable 2FA and do everything in your power to stay safe and secure. Let everyone know.
Hey streamer friends!
May wanna change your stream key, password, and if you haven't already please enable 2 factor authentication!
Gonna play some games now!
See ya in chat!
I think out of everything I learned out of retail, I learned to respect myself and not let other's detract or try to push me over.
I was a very kind and caring manager and would go WAY out of my way to accommodate you if given respect.

The downside?
That Ferrari has the brakes of a tricycle." -LonnieIIV

But seriously.
Who will lick my elbow?
Makers and anyone who uses the USPS to ship their merch.
Can you do me a big favor and try and quantify how badly the new price changes and surcharges are once they go into effect on the 3rd?
Is it going to be better to start using FedEx or UPS?
Not feeling the greatest. Probably gonna push off stream for tonight.
Yo I'm dressing up as a vaccine this Halloween.

Related to my last tweet, who has fond memories of an old game called Myst?

If y'all do, you should DEFINITELY check out Outer Wilds. They evoke the same kind of feeling.
0.05 Ethereum is $149. For that price I will happily design you an actually appealing, original, and unique fursona - no money to the techbros, and no harm to the planet either. Why play into a corporate cashgrab when you can support small artists instead?

Anyone know any fursuit head bag makers/vendors? Would like to get one before BLFC so I don't have to use a trash bag.

PLEASE PLEASE if you want to buy a fursuit from a maker, ASK QUESTIONS! Like ALOT of them! If your maker isn’t providing easily accessible transparency in what they provide ASK THEM DIRECTLY! This ensure you have healthy expectations of what is possible going into a transaction.

After 3 years, 9 months and 16 days (1386 days) Bayonetta 3 has finally an official trailer. You can watch it here:
Brewster means so much to me.
Wild World was a powerful game as I grew up and I loved just sitting back, drinking coffee, and enjoying the tunes.
I've been waiting for his return for so long.
This will literally revive my ACNH interest and will be doing an Island restart.
I miss Splatoon.
I'm actually so freaking excited for this.
In 2022.
This household becomes a Splat 3 Esports house.
I can't believe they are dropping a compatible N64 controller for the Switch.
It's so bad. Nostalgia is not good enough reason for me to want to drop a pro controller for it.
Why can't they just release the next Mario Kart? Why Chocobo GP which is literally a MK clone.
Ok. So that Direct started off so bad.
But Fuck me up with Brewster, Kirby, Splatoon 3, Dread, and also huge shout out to the fans of Bayonetta 3.
Y'all have waited long enough.
KAIJU FIGHTS
OMG BAYONETTA
I NEED A DATE?! WHY 2022?!
SPLATOON 3?!?!?!?!?!?
LETS FUCKING GO
Oh my god. Everyone else is gonna be so freaking good. but why Chris Pratt.
How the fuck is Chris Pratt going to work as Mario in an animated movie.
How.
YO
Props for Deltarune Chapter 2 being on the Switch already.
BEHIND A PAYWALLLLLL
FUCK YOU NINTENDO
ONLINE MULTIPLAYER N64 GAMES ?!?!?!
Metroid Dread Report live reading stream?
Y'all think that'd be cool?
Fuck Dread looks so cool.
I am so excited to see how this adventure comes to an end.
WOW
They are rebooting KOTR to the Switch.
Might be the sleeper power move no one saw.
MY BOY #Brewster is gonna be back?! LETS GO!
Time to revive my island!!!
THE ROOST IS BACK BABY
Chocobo racing but no MK9 yet?
Its a literal reskin of mario kart...
This Kirby game looks fire though
Look, Bro, It's not gay! I'm just saving your life!

I remember when I got covid, I was laying in bed drenched in sweat while struggling to breathe wondering if I was gonna wake up the next morning. My lungs still haven't recovered. This virus is some NASTY stuff. Get vaccinated. I did. I assure you my testicles are fine.

How. How is a life saving, hospital/ICU preventing vaccine controversial?
How is it so divisive?
I'm just utterly beside myself.
We are supposed to love each other and care for each other.
Protect each other.
Have some compassion and GET THE VACCINE.
I have mixed feelings on a ban I did tonight.
A follower said they were anti vaxx and made some bad takes full of misinformation.
They weren't being mean, they just states their beliefs.

The grind is real.

I wanted to make a Hoss meme too, cause I was feeling left out.
Damn. Wow.

Sea of Thieves was great! Valorant was a mixed bag!
We'll grind back into silver 1 again soon!
