# PROJECT-FRNN

### Description
##### Basically, this project uses an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to generate text. 
##### The text this *SHOULD* generate, will be a tweet (Twitter).
##### The generated text will be scanned against a wordlist of (potentially and unpotentially) offensive words / phrases.
##### If the generated text or "tweet" passes WITHOUT any forbidden words in it, the API will upload it to the @FRNN_AI Twitter account.
