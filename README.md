# PROJECT-FRNN

### Description
Basically, this project uses an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to generate text. 
The text this *SHOULD* generate, will be a tweet (Twitter).
The generated text will be scanned against a wordlist of (potentially and unpotentially) offensive words / phrases.
If the generated text or "tweet" passes WITHOUT any forbidden words in it, the API will upload it to the @FRNN_AI Twitter account. Link here: "https://twitter.com/@FRNN_AI"

If you see this project and the AI has tweeted something offensive and / or something that you think should not be tweeted, 
please tell me at my contacts below. Thank you for reading!


### Information about the gathered data:
This project uses about 48 000 tweets from 72 accounts. 
These tweets and accounts are easily and publicly available in the project folders. 
You can find the raw, and trained data in the "ASSETS" folder. 
You can also find the used accounts in the "usernames.txt" file also located in the "ASSETS" folder. 
If you wish to have your tweets / usernames / account name removed from this project, contact me at my listed contacts below and i will be happy to remove them.
