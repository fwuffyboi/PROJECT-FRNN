# PROJECT-FRNN

### Description
Basically, this project uses an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to generate text. 
The text this *SHOULD* generate, will be a tweet (Twitter).
The generated text will be scanned against a wordlist of (potentially and unpotentially) offensive words / phrases.
If the generated text or "tweet" passes WITHOUT any forbidden words in it, the API will upload it to the @FRNN_AI Twitter account. Link here: "https://twitter.com/@FRNN_AI"

If you see this project and the AI has tweeted something offensive and / or something that you thik should not be tweeted, 
please tell me at @fwuffyboi on twitter or "BISCUITISNOTACOOKIE@protonmail.com". Thank you for reading!
